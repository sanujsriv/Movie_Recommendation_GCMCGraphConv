tt9288030,ur13977076,9,9 February 2022,"Jack Reacher is a former major in the military police; when he head to the small town of Margrave, Georgia he hopes to learn a bit more about a favourite blues musician who died there... he did not expect to be arrested for murder as he had a meal in a diner! He is cleared, but not until after spending some dangerous time in jail. A startling revelation about the identity of the dead man leads to Reacher becoming determined to find those responsible and deal with them... permanently. He ends up working alongside two members of the police; local policewoman Roscoe Conklin and detective Oscar Finlay, a man who previously served the police in Boston. Together they find links to some very dangerous people, including some of the towns more respected citizens.I really enjoyed this series; I had planned to watch an episode a day but got so hooked I ploughed through it far more quickly. There is plenty of action in every episode and a solid story. While the story is spread over eight episodes it reminded me of those old shows where a protagonist would arrive in a new town each episode and solve a local problem before moving on. Even though one never doubts that Reacher will prevail in every confrontation the fight scenes are exciting and look fairly real. The cast is solid; Alan Ritchson impresses as Reacher, he certainly has the look; Malcolm Goodwin contrasts nicely as the thoroughly decent Detective Finlay and Willa Fitzgerald is solid as Officer Conklin. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; I hope we get further seasons.",92,129,/user/ur13977076/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur0438066,TxM,7 February 2022,"New TV series streaming from Amazon, my wife and I watched two episodes on each of four successive nights. Sort of like movie nights. This is not high art, the writing has lots of humor, in real life Reacher couldn't get away with everything depicted. BUT ... it is a very entertaining series. Especially for those of us who enjoy seeing a smart, mild-mannered, well-spoken, well-trained, big tough guy put the bad guys in their places. Some simple thugs, some unruly prison inmates, some dirty cops. Ritchson is a r real good pick for the role. (In an interview he said he gained 30 pounds for the role.)Reacher is an ex-military man, he takes a bus to the small Georgia town, walks to town to look up an old blues singer's home, immediately gets arrested for murder, but eventually works with local law enforcement to help solve the mysteries, and there are several.Most episodes are roughly 45 to 50 minutes long, set in a fictional Georgia town not far from Atlanta. Cast and characters are interesting. The story is not too deep but surprisingly interesting, just good entertainment. Streaming on Amazon.",89,117,/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur2767381,lava,9 February 2022,"If not spectacular, ""Reacher"" was an eminently watchable and entertaining miniseries. It is anchored by a giant Redwood of a man named Jack Reacher, whose paramilitary and intelligence background figure in the action.The taciturn superhero arrives in the small, fictional town of Margrave, Georgia, to discover a major counterfeiting operation run by a family of cutthroats and their goons. Along the way, Reacher bonds with the local sheriff and discovers his deepest secret of guilt for not spending more time with deceased wife. A budding romance ensues between Reacher and the female deputy named Roscoe Conklin.Some of the best scenes in the film were the flashbacks of young Reacher growing up with his brother Joe as military brats. Their wise mother, a Frenchwoman, recognized the boys' gifts as leaders and gave them special advice that helped to shape their futures.There was a clever approach to the counterfeiting idea and some especially nasty characters running the operation. At every turn, Reacher feels betrayed by someone whom he trusted. The filmmakers integrated some humor with lively banter and one-liners.The size and brawn of Jack Reacher suggested a superhero-type who arrives in town to clean up the corruption much like a classic Western. While there was predictability in this by-the-numbers series, each episode was well-directed and well-performed. One can even get a sense of the smell and taste of that delicious Georgia peach pie served at the local diner.",39,51,/user/ur2767381/?ref_=tt_urv

Cruise, one of the most powerful Hollywood hitters, missed. This version is not bad.3. Spillaine wrote novels right to the end. Child wants beach time and passed the franchise to a family member. That never works well.4. Banshee was a better production. Reacher however has an instant worldwide audience. No contest.",36,113,/user/ur44112735/?ref_=tt_urv

I wouldn't compare Reacher with detective shows like The Bridge or Criminal Minds - it reminds me rather of Banshee (2013), with a little lower action and violence level.

tt9288030,ur3580907,6,18 February 2022,"A big reason you may watch, or not, is if you like Alan Ritchson's character Reacher. For me it's a likable portrayal of the cunning wolf who has a heart hidden by his ability to dispense final justice with cold efficiency. That's pretty much why I watched as much of the rest of the Reacher cast and story wasn't as good. Think a veiled remake of Walking Tall and you can sense the mix of good and not so good. Reacher aspires for realism but goes off from that quite often. With a really tight and real story the character of Reacher would be fully realized. In the end, good not great.",15,27,/user/ur3580907/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur68519886,7,6 February 2022,"This plays like a 1950s John Wayne movie where the hero is the All-American boy next door, pure of heart and kills only bad guys! He is invincible, just an average guy, not a super hero in Spandex or with special powers. He saves damsels (and animals) in distress and has a heart of gold.The plot for the series is a bit convoluted. The special effects are gory, but relevant to the plot. The action is fast paced and there are a few surprises. It is a very entertaining series that keeps viewers engaged. The best thing about it is the complete lack of ""Wokeness"" that is so pervasive in many of the current series.",157,215,/user/ur68519886/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur117926588,9,7 February 2022,"Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson), a former U. S. Army military policeman, now lives as a drifter carrying only his passport, cash, and a French military service medal. Upon his arrival in the rural town of Margrave, Georgia, Reacher is arrested for his suspected murder of a man found dead near an overpass. Boston born and Harvard educated Chief Detective Oscar Finlay (Malcolm Goodwin) is suspicious of Reacher while Officer Roscoe Conklin (Willa Fitzgerald) is more receptive of Reacher's presence in the town. When a banker named Paul Hubble (Marc Bendavid) confesses to the crime without any corroborating evidence Reacher becomes embroiled in a mystery which only raises more questions when it's revealed the man murdered under the overpass was in fact Reacher's estranged brother Joe.Based on the Jack Reacher series of books by Lee Child, Reacher marks the latest attempt to mine the books for adaptation following the Tom Cruise led film franchise fizzling out with the divisive follow up Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. While I enjoyed the Tom Cruise films to a degree (even the second one wasn't terrible) it's undeniable Tom Cruise did not match the description Child created in the books. Now free of the constraints that come with feature films and given more breathing room with 8 episodes, Reacher is fun detective fiction that creates an engaging narrative and a likable protagonist played by Alan Ritchson.Alan Ritchson is fantastic as Reacher as he plays the character as a man with a strong sense of justice. Reacher doesn't actively seek out trouble, but if it happens to find him he makes it clear that it will regret having sought him out. Ritchson gives the character a lot of humor with his laid back charisma leading to some genuinely humorous moments between the various baddies he encounters as well as in his alliances with Finlay and Roscoe. Malcolm Goodwin is a solid ally for Reacher as despite being a man of intellect and character, he's not above getting his hands (or his tweed suit) dirty in pursuit of ridding the town of corruption despite often being looked upon as an outsider. Willa Fitzgerald is really good as Roscoe who has great chemistry with Ritchson and despite being a love interest isn't overly sexualized and can hold her own against the villains. The show's mystery is engaging with Reacher and his allies tracking down leads throughout the town of Margrave with actors like Bruce McGill, Chris Webster, Willie C. Carpenter, Harvey Guillen, and Kristin Kreuk giving solid performances as the various characters Reacher and company come into contact with.Reacher is terrific entertainment. Alan Ritchson is perfectly cast as the titular Jack Reacher and is surrounded by a solid supporting cast who make the mystery entertaining and thrilling. The show promises even further adventures for the character derived from the books and if they stay at the level of this season I can see this having legs.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur20309759,1,7 February 2022,"It started off strong but and then devolved very quickly into not making much sense and loaded with incredible coincidences. I like the actors, but the story was just too farfetched for me. This whole idea of fictionalizing America as more violent and dangerous than any war zone is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.It's like the writers were too bad or stupid to care about making any sense at all, or they don't care because viewers are too stupid to care. Whichever scenario this is, Reacher is as unbelievable and childish as any comic book adaptation, and I don't do comic book adaptations-I'm a grown man.It's like the writers think that if they just throw in enough fights and shootouts that makes it good. It's like the guy can't walk by a group of three or more other dudes without beating them up. ""He started it"" is not a defense for manslaughter. Reacher would have about two dozen assault charges and four or five murder investigations pending against him. Reacher was a military cop for 20 years and he takes the law into his own hands every chance he gets? He must have been a lousy cop, like all of the yahoos shooting people for no good reason.This wasn't good and seemed to be digging itself deeper into a pit of stupidity with every episode. Whenever they showed Reacher's prowess for deductive reasoning, it was just too much. ""The moon was at first quarter that night and would have cast a shadow..."" Too much.I really wanted to like this series; I swear. I couldn't make it through even one of the books, although I started a few of them. Just sort of too preposterous for me, but I really liked the Reacher character, or at least aspects of him. I actually like the Tom Cruise version, but once again, the story was too much, too conspiratorial, too complicated, too stupid.In this series, I thought all the actors were great. Reacher was good and size-appropriate for the book character. Roscoe was convincing. I really liked the chubby kid at the morgue. He was funny and his small role brought a lot to the show.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur20309759/?ref_=tt_urv

There are some elements I like - the background material in particular. But I don't think it works when you have a big guy beating up smaller guys. In Tom Cruise's case the little guy beat up the big guy, but in this case it's hard to cheer for the big guy defeating the little guys.

We finally have the next generation of action hero after the huge hole left by Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Ritchson nails the role and is a true modern day hero...a good guy, not some criminal anti-hero like so many of today's action films. He has a commanding presence like John Wayne and Arnold. What a refreshing change from all the small man complex actors who want to play tough guys. Well written, well cast and totally engrossing. The character of Roscoe was also very well played.

It's early yet so the ratings a bit high at 8.9, but it'll end up being in the high 7's and that's about right. I'm certainly glad I watched it. Very entertaining and much better than most the recent crime shows out.

Specially after the first great movie, and the ""not-so-good"" sequel.The casting is superb! Alan Ritchson is quite intimidating (although a bit much of a bodybuilder for a hobo that has no consistent training), and quite likeable. The season as a whole is a great adaptation of the book it represents, with lots of added little moments of backstory for character development/understanding not present in the original Killing Floor story, and immaculate execution.I hope this becomes a thing!!

An interesting crime story that reminds us of good old-fashioned entertainment.The story follows the atmosphere from the books well, and the casting is great. Alan Ritchson is a great choice for the role of Jack Reacher, not only does he look like him, but he conveyed his character well on screen.Most of today's series is unwatchable, but this is a really positive surprise. The series follows the plot of the first book, ""Killing Floor,"" and Reacher tries to find the culprits responsible for a series of murders.The show is a real surprise, because it does not suffer from most of the common flaws of today's film production. There are only a few small things that could be better, but this is definitely better than the vast majority of today's shows, because it tries to entertain the viewer, and not bother him with unnecessary things.The fight scenes are excellent, tense and brutal. Alan Ritchson is convincing in the role of Jack Reacher, but the other actors also portrayed their characters well. A really pleasant surprise, considering that most good stories are ruined by today's writers.The show looks interesting, very cinematic and is well directed.

tt9288030,ur6025018,9,13 February 2022,"I've not read any of the Jack Reacher novels. I thought that the first ""Jack Reacher"" film with Tom Cruise was good. This series puts those films to shame.While Cruise didn't have the imposing physique, he did seem to possess Reacher's wit. But a two-hour film isn't enough to give us a true picture of Jack Reacher like this series is able.I first saw Alan Ritchson in Season 4 episode of Smallville where he played a young ""Aquaman."" Years later in Titans. But Ritchson absolutely nails the Reacher role. He plays him cooly, intelligently, and as though he knows as much about the character as Lee Child does. Word has it that he read all of the Reacher novels, so it may not be that much of a stretch to suggest that his knowledge of the character is on par with Child's.What starts out as a seemingly simple murder case, quickly cascades into a massive conspiracy and leaving the viewer to wonder who is involved and who isn't. It takes exceptional writing to pull this off well; to make the viewer begin to question everyone. What makes it better, is that despite his massive frame, Reacher is incredibly smart. He sees and notices things that average detectives don't. As I was watching Ritchson, I couldn't help thinking: ""This guy might make the perfect Batman.""When you find yourself watching 2-3 episodes at a time, then you know you've got yourself a gem of a series. While there are some graphic scenes, nothing feels like it's done gratuitously. It's all there for a reason. No more and no less.Anyone who watches this series is going to forget the films completely. This is the Reacher series that sets the true bar.

tt9288030,ur4413144,9,10 February 2022,"Bottom line: Ritchson is head & shoulders above Cruise's portrayal of Reacher (no pun intended). I think casting Cruise was banking on the audience not knowing the story. Here, we get Ritchson, who truly embodies the character, which even Lee Child is not shy to point out. Alan actually read all the books to prepare for his role. He's been in a lot but this will be the role that defines his career, I think. Willa Fitzgerald is perfectly cast as the small but mighty Detective & sidekick. There are a lot of great cast here, including Jenkins and White who perfectly portray the brothers in their youth. Seasoned viewers will see a collage of familiar action scenarios and characters here, although the lack of uniqueness doesn't detract from the great presence of the series on its own merits. In fact, Ritchson could be said to resemble Schwarzenegger and Cruise with a bit of JCVD. The show reminds me of a cross of Hardy Boys, Jack Ryan, Justified, and The Equalizer just to name a few.There is a good story, good action, and some clever humor. But beware, there is some pretty shocking visuals in this series. Parents should not take the MA rating lightly.

Since this only covered one of them, the road is already paved for many more seasons to savor. I quickly understood why fans of the print Reacher hated the Cruise incarnation of their hero. Fight sequences here were executed at feature-film levels.I'm parsimonious with my 9s and 10s, but this one flirted with that lofty realm. Points off for the following: Wasting Kristin Kreuk by casting her in such a wimpy little role. She would have made a fine Roscoe, based on several of her previous gigs. The material could have been covered more excitingly if trimmed to 6 or 7 episodes. I would have liked seeing how the young brothers handled the bullies in those flashbacks.

'Reacher' is a crime thriller streaming show developed for Amazon Prime Video. It is based on Lee Child's series of popular books regarding a former military policeman who rights wrongs. This first season of Amazon's 'Reacher' is based on the first book about Jack Reacher, 'Killing Floor'. The show stars Alan Ritchson who most would recognize from his stints in various DC shows including 'Smallville' and more recently 'Titans'. The show has already been renewed for a second season.Jack Reacher is a former military cop now disillusioned and wary of the government he served faithfully. He now lives essentially as a hobo with just the clothes on his back and money in his pocket. He has little to know digital footprint and he excels at uncovering and destroying bad guys. While in theory Reacher is supposed to be more of an antihero he winds up devolving into straight up hero by the end of the show which I imagine is a pretty standard arc for him in any given story. He randomly blows into a quiet, rural Georgia town to walk in the footsteps of an old, nearly forgotten blues man. The welcome wagon is not too welcoming and before long he is under arrest and uncovering a massive town conspiracy that reaches all the way to the federal government. Of course most people from law enforcement to the citizenry thing this Frankenstein looking stranger is the bad guy, however, Reacher is nothing if not tenacious and for reasons private and personal he is going to get to the bottom of what is going on in this town.'Reacher' is a bit of a mixed bag. In some ways it is decent and has potential, and in other ways it is bordering on silly. The first comparison to be made is between this show and its star to the two Reacher feature films and their star Tom Cruise. There was much hemming and hawing when Cruise was cast as Jack Reacher as he does not fit the physical dynamic of the character (i.e. Big). Tom Cruise is a lot of things, but big is not one of them. He actually did as well with the role as he could making up for in vitality what he lacked in stature. Along comes Ritchson who is a beast of a man; a truly impressive physical specimen. We now have the appropriate stature, but this version of Reacher is much more subdued and sedate which works well for the character. Every joke now becomes about Reacher's size. Sometimes it is funny and sometimes that humor just becomes excessive and eye rolling. The enemies in this movie are ridiculously, cartoonishly evil, and the mystery is laid out in a convoluted way. For a story with a simple premise sometimes it was hard to keep track of what lead was being followed along with certain character interrelations. Eventually the mystery is solved and a lot of bad guys are killed and maimed in glorious fashion along the way which is basically what you tune in for. Outside of Reacher I wasn't super in love with any of the characters here, but since it seems each season will be a new mystery in a different place character overlap won't be a thing. This first season was a bit weak as far as the story went. The story was basic, a little silly and not very riveting. Ritchson did a good job portraying Reacher and the action was decently entertaining. This series is worthy of continuing. I just hope the writing can be ratcheted up a notch or two, and then this thing has a chance of really getting good.",3,4,/user/ur44376731/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur52460694,8,9 February 2022,"Amazon's version of Lee Child's ""Jack Reacher Novel Series"" stars Alan Ritchson as ex-Army Ranger and now retired Military Policeman Jack Reacher who arrives in the fictional town of Margrave, Georgia looking for his brother Joe. He becomes embroiled in a murder investigation first as an unlikely suspect then an informal 'deputy' to Senior Detective Oscar Findlay (Malcolm Goodwin), a Harvard educated black former Boston PD out of place in white rural Georgia and his able, feisty and beautiful Sergeant Rosco Conklin (Willa Fitzgerald). Pretty quickly Reacher finds his brother was a Secret Service agent trying to break open a massive counterfeiting operation secretly run by the wealthy Kliner family who hide their crimes by revitalizing the small town and buying off the mayor and key police.Reacher, Findlay and Rosco must run hard and smart to stay ahead of the rising body count and rampant corruption to avenge the death of his brother Joe and bring the criminals to heel. The series is also punctuated with events that shaped Reacher's early life, and the beginning of his 'take no prisoners' approach, shown as flashbacks to the 12 year old Reacher ably played by 15 year old Maxwell Jenkins.I prefer Ritchson to Tom Cruise as Reacher. He's more physically imposing but maintains his interesting edge of silent, cryptic aloofness. The lead actors across the board are strong and believable, the pace is brisk and the plot lines are taut, flow well and keep you strongly engaged.

At times this first series makes ""24"" and ""Die Hard"" look like fly on the wall documentaries, and if you were judging it on believability it would score 3 or 4. It nevertheless gets a 7 from me however, because the lead three cast members are all excellent and there is plenty of good fun to be had along the way, as long as you don't think too hard. Alan Ritchson in particular achieves the near impossible task of making Reacher himself believable as a character and brings a lot of humour to the role and I'd hope to see more of Willa Fitzgerald and Malcolm Goodwin in future seasons.

While the book, films, and series have much in common, they definitely are not the same. And that's probably why the book, the films, and now this new series, are so enjoyable.Think of Reacher as a ""variation on a theme."" Where I thought the series wouldn't work, it worked very well, especially when it came to developing the characters. In 8 episodes you have an opportunity to gradually get to know each important character, learn how and why they react with other characters, and just as importantly, understand their motivations. Good writing is apparent throughout each ""cliff hanging"" episode.The major difference was the actors that played the role of Jack Reacher. Alan Ritchson clearly fit the novel's character description of Jack Reacher. Can you say ""GIANT?"" But I have to give Cruise credit too. Although his body type isn't the same as Ritchson's, his sardonic, calm, cool take on Reacher's character is so ridiculously perfect it almost makes it ""impossible"" to forget. Mission Impossible?

And he is quite impressive, the result of real-life hard work, commitment, prolonged discipline and time spent at the gym. Alan has also perfected the nonchalant, snide yet endearing tone of this Reacher, therefore we can let it slide that his acting chops obviously do not measure up to Tom Cruise's. The convoluted, ultimately uninteresting plot is also secondary and so we can let that slide, too.

tt9288030,ur34064689,8,17 February 2022,"I'll be honest, From the outset I didn't like the look of this show. All I saw was a muscled up jock who resembled nothing of the great Tom Cruise and his stellar performance in the Jack Reacher films. I watched the trailer for Reacher and it looked like one big cheese fest of a show where there would be lots explosions and gunfights with absolutely no story.However somewhere along the line after seeing it get much higher ratings than I expected I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did. It had much more of a thriller vibe instead of just dumb action, plus the story and acting was a much higher standard than I thought.I have to say the first episode was by FAR the best. Seeing Reacher beat up a guy he called ""Fatso"" shortly before punching and elbowing his face in was an excellent scene in which Reacher was in prison and trying to survive. The dialogue in that particular scene was excellent and the tension shortly before Reacher made a fool out of the man was exciting. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the threat of violence is just as important as the violence itself. You can have the bang bang shootouts but you need good dialogue between characters and that happened in every scene of episode one. Throughout the rest of the episode we get a more detailed backstory as to why Reacher had initially came to Margrave and how he is now involved in a serious situation, one that got his brother killed.As the rest of the episodes unfold we see Reacher trying to avenge his brothers death all while slowly falling for a local cop Roscoe and working with a tough nosed out of towner Finley. Reacher has always been known as someone who has an extraordinary level of intelligence but there were certain times where in order for the show to drag things out over multiple episodes he had to suddenly become a bit of a fool. The animal feed thing was pretty obvious as although I initially suspected the bags were full of cash I quickly realised that no matter what they were used for it was clearly something that needed immediate investigation, this doesn't happen. Instead this major storyline is drawn out over the remaining 5-6 episodes before finally coming to a head in episode 7 when the full story is revealed. This all felt too slow to unravel and that makes me worry as a show with only 8 episodes feeling slow at times is going to hard to fix in season 2, the writers are going to have to come up with something special if they want the show to be exciting every single episode going forward.As the show came to an end I begin to drift away from it slightly as I let somewhat turned into the generic shoot em up forgettable action show that I worried it would, however there was still just enough storyline to keep me watching and intrigued to see how it all ended.The final shootout was a wild affair but I particularly laughed at Finley turning into the black John Mcclane and with his tank top and shoulder holster on he begins shooting people left and right before squashing Picard in some sort of crusher machinery.Switching to a flashback of Reachers dying mother kept it from being a stale ending and explained why he keeps a medal with him. Peach pie is served and off Reacher goes to find another town and another problem to solve.Overall this show far exceeded my expectations as I went in expecting the absolute worst but was pleasantly surprised. I still fear for the shows long terms success as the first season did feel slightly drawn out despite it having only 8 episodes. However If the writers can put the time into to creating a thrilling new story then I'll definitely be back for season 2.",1,3,/user/ur34064689/?ref_=tt_urv

Bish bash bosh. Job done. Rinse. Repeat.Love books like that. They're like comfort food. You buy them knowing they're going to deliver a satisfying hit that will juice your brain just enough to leave you wanting just one more...now!When it comes to TV shows you need them to flow from one pressing situation to the next, with characters you don't mind spending time with. They can't be hard work, which is where Reacher nails it.Pretty much everyone is spot on, from Richarson's dry quippy (sometimes a bit too much) pragmatist who unintentionally wanders into trouble before breaking its legs and arms and so makes the world a better place one s-hole town at a time.Malcolm Goodwin and Willa Fitzgerald are good fun as the doubting buddies to be who he wins over.

I am a huge fan of Alan Ritchson ever since I first was introduced to him in Blue Mountain State. He does a wonderful job as Jack Reacher in this but the show never really shows him as that same kind of investigator and don't write him that way. They make him more of a lumbering oaf with some investigative instincts. This show made me really think of Rambo more so.

Furthermore, because of the colour of shirt and the collar size, I believe you to be a father of 2 children. Now how about that peach pie or a punch to the face?""It's like that throughout. From crack end of his butt, he figures out all sort of things from location of people (no one can find) to what went down at a crime scene.Which, frankly, is quite fun (if somewhat ridiculous). I mean really it's an educated guess that seems to pay off 100% of the time.It is the rose tinted version of what a person should be. Smart, stacked, able to fight and live a nomadic lifestyle. A free spirited hippy chess grandmaster with guns.And episode after episode, you want to know what happens next.These are positives. It's compelling.There are a few negatives, but that's just the nature of the beast. In that the negatives are really part and parcel of this series. With the lump of wood acting, you get logic lapses (the biggest coincidence of all is never explained and there are a quite few of these), a pity **** in the shower for no reason, shirt off every couple of episodes (you can't blame him) and a weak BIG BAD fight scene in the final episode.Look despite these points (and many others besides), the whole thing chugs along at a reasonable pace. It is some far fetched nonsense (and I am sure Reacher book fans may disagree - but it is true of this series) BUT nonetheless it makes up for all that by being entertaining enough to see it out to the end.There will likely be an season 2 which hopefully may tighten up the logic lapses, reduces the convenient coincidences and see our hero get into some seriously dangerous situations which only he can get out of.Reacher = (McGuyver + Holmes + Littlest Hobo) x Brick ****house.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur4803434/?ref_=tt_urv

It starts out as if this will be a single loner against a town but he soon develops allies as the mystery that roped him in grows increasingly deeper and stranger. There are a few instances where the story rolls well into PG-13 or so territory which surprised me.There is also a welcome lack of wokeness in a story that unfolds believably - at least for a TV drama. I doubt there's much that's realistic even within the story's context. For example, the drifter, Reacher, seems able to take on any number of attackers until it helps the story that he fights to a draw so another player steps in to help.My wife's favorite TV is calm PBS British costume dramas so when she went binge on this after, as she said, being drawn into the story within 10 minutes, I was curious to see for myself what had gotten her so far off her usual genre.

Still, I regret none of it. Every minute was well spent.This show balances drama, action and hints of comedy excellently. This is a show that is not trying to do anything other than entertain its audience with a balance of those three things, and does it right.The acting is good, the pacing and script is tight, scenes aren't wasted and you genuinely get a sense of who each character is and where they are at in life; liking the main cast of protagonists more as a result.If I were to level any constructive criticism, it would be that our villains are a little cartoonist and ridiculously OTT at times; giving up exposition that will definitely get them killed, like a Bond villain giving up their plan right before 007 is almost certainly going to foil it.But even that minor critique doesn't take away from the quality of thus show in any major way, it'd measly a minor observation...and, although cliché, it still adds to the kudos of the finale.This is a show done right.

Exactly the same can be said of this production, it's not great art but it gets the job done and the time spent viewing is worth it.

This TV series has finally portrayed an accurate Reacher on film, as we all know him from the books - which are the world's number one best selling series of novels. There was some deviations from the book Killing Floor which series 1 is based on, but that is understandable because screenplays cannot completely encompass what has been done in a book (and other issues come into play). However, I am looking forward to many future Reacher TV series, and I hope that a studio can one day create a movie with Alan Ritchson in the role and with the screenplay writers from the TV series - maybe based on Tripwire?

Some scenes happen too fast, which only adds to the confusion. Some don't feel too well explained, while Reacher and CO takes them as daily routine, which also doesn't help if you are slightly behind in plot.Fights are good, heavy, really solid stuff.There's one thing that made me laugh out loud. So Reacher is a buff 196cm dude. He's huge. His muscles have muscles. His arms are bigger than my tights (and i'm quite fat). He's also quite handsome.. Or at least I think he is. In short: he's like super model, but made for action movies.While watching this show you'll see him shirtless MANY TIMES. Like it was obvious that was something he added from his side of contract ""ok, if u want me to play Reacher, make at least 3 zoom-ins on my ABS every episode"". In first ep he gets to change clothes in changing room, where female cop waits outside. Ofcourse he HAD to jump out of the changing room, shirtless and I kid you not, female actress didn't have to act the urgent need to change panties. Her knees buckled up. She was like ""holy moly, thank god i signed for sx scene in next few episodes, this dude is total banger. Can't wait, can i have 2 sx scenes maybe?"".This is spoilery so: later we find that Reachers brother has been killed. Quite devastating, right? Well, not for horny female cop! Brother? What brother? Who cares, Lets bang! XDOk, jokes aside.. I had one issue with this show. I haven't read the book, so maybe it's true to its origin, however, even if so, i don't think it had to be translated to a show. I'm talking about ""white male bad"". If you see someone that can be described by those 2 characteristics ""white"" and ""male"", he'll be portrayed as evil, wrong, disgusting, corrupted, spoiled, or at least very stupid person.

The storyline and supporting cast are excellant so if you have read the book, Killing Floor you will not be disappointed and even if you did not read the book it is well produced and worth your time.

You know you're going to have to suspend your disbelief for this one.It managed to keep that vibe throughout, but it did go into silly territory a bit too often and a bit too far for my tastes in the second half of the season. As it turns out: heavy suspension of disbelief is required, even more than I anticipated.The witty and clever remarks Reacher makes in the first half, get downgraded to mostly emotionless, borderline autistic comments in the second half, which is really a shame.The story unfolds like an 80's action movie, where you know no one you like is going to get hurt and all the bad guys die. Reacher manages to uncover what's going on way too easily and out of nowhere, with what appears to be psychic powers and everything that happens is entirely predictable.In that regard, much of the second half of the season feels rushed, because in the first half, the creators at least tried (and managed) to give most things a logical explanation.Acting is mostly decent but otherwise nothing special. Willa Fitzgerald is a pleasant surprise.The show doesn't try to be more than it is, and if you know what to expect, don't expect a masterpiece and realize it's ultimately pretty forgettable, this may be exactly what the doctor ordered.7,5/10, rounding down to a 7.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur27886138/?ref_=tt_urv

He did deliver nuance, but, with Reacher physically imposing size is part of the story - part of how he gets to do what he does - and an important part of his natural humor.

He's likable, but very rigid (and I don't mean his muscles), and despite his size, his baby face looks isn't all that intimidating, despite how hard he tries. His delivery feels a bit more like someone with Asperger. Henry Cavill may have pulled off Jack Reacher better. But he makes it up with his size and fight choreography that is unquestionably fearsome. Most of the other actors are fairly one-dimensional, but a few veteran faces smooth out the casting. Willa Fitzgerald and Malcom Goodwin are both very good here.Despite the nice plot pacing and interesting build-up, the climax felt a bit trivial and predictable, and a little bit eyerolling.

Alan Ritchson's Reacher could eat Tom Cruise's pathetic portrayal of the eponymous character for breakfast and still have room for a generous helpng of the best Georgian peach pie and a gallon of coffee. If Ritchson was a little more swarthy he would be a perfect Reacher chacterization but at six feet five and full of muscle and a better actor than Cruise I am prepared to overlook the lack of beard growth as the show is updated for today's audiences. Faithful to the Lee Child books this looks to be a winner of a show. Keep up the good work.,88,119,/user/ur38521699/?ref_=tt_urv

The lead is much more akin to the character from the books and he certainly towers over everyone, he's huge! The fight scenes are violent at times and it is often easy for Reacher to take many baddies at a time (unfortunately). The storyline isn't hard to figure out and it becomes irritating because you know what's going to happen next.The police, even the main detective, are incompetent! It starts out right away arresting, jailing, and even placing Reacher in county without any evidence or attorney! They even toss another guy in their with Reacher even though the lead detective knows he's innocent! Terrible, just terrible! Then we have the wealthy town guy who owns everything and people lick his boots which is so old!I really think they should have picked a different story or combined it with another book because about 5 episodes in the season feels bloated. It really needed more to do or at least better story treatments. Overall, it's a good start of a series though it needs some tweaks.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur77752279/?ref_=tt_urv

If you can suspend reality then you'll overcome the biggest hurdle I had.The premise of the story is decent. On the whole, the acting is solid. The performance by Willa Fitzgerald (Roscoe) as the female lead was the most refreshing female lead I've seen in a long time as she mostly behaved like a normal human being. Disappointingly, the performance of Maria Sten (Neagley) was cringeworthy. Fitzgerald played modestly, relatable, confident and strong in that she stood by her conviction without being a 2D ninja warrior.Alan Ritchson (Reacher) played the role as charming, arrogant and highly confident. It was a fine line between likeable and not. Had Netflix made this series, Reacher would have ticked a box of some sort. In this series, you felt that box ticking was not important. Mind you, one of the black characters was poorly done. Without any spoilers, they were totally shallow. I would have preferred more nuance.The real problem with the series is the lack of logic. People are being murdered everywhere by professionals. Crack shots and psychos. However, they never seem to be able to kill the three lead characters. This made no sense.The series is best summarised as follows. The series avoids woke tropes. Reacher is not emasculated in any way. The acting is decent (mostly). However, the logic sometimes fails.

The casting of Cruise was, as others say, ridiculous for obvious height differences. Being tall was probably the ONLY detail that Childs reiterates about Reacher and Hollywood threw it out the window.Amazon to the rescue? Maybe. This Reacher casting is possibly a bit too much in the other direction though. Too beefy. I believed Reacher to be 'knawly', rugged and deceptively strong. Not straight out of a LA gym and whom most would never dream of picking a fight with.However, after shaking that off, I settled down and found Ritchson to be rather likeable and watchable and, very much to the credit of the writers, it proved that less can be so much more when it comes to dialogue. I did, on more than one occasion found myself laughing which is always entertaining. We can all agree, there was, indeed, a lot of cattle feed. :)I liked the two other supporting roles a lot. Again, no need to try to over complicate the relationships between them when Reacher is a man of few words. That would be too difficult to do on screen, so don't bother and judge that fact fairly. I think some expected complicated and intimate dialogue between the 3 like other Crime Dramas. Nope. That should not happen and would break character.I binged happily over two days.

I feel like this is a missed opportunity, those quirks were what made the character unique and some attempts at that come off cheap, like Reacher spurts deductions sometimes at worse speed and show-off than Brits' TV-show ""Sherlock"". There's also typical magical computers with ""enhance"" feature, hand grenades with a big blinking red light and high-pitched tone, and other dumb things that only serve to insult the viewer. Well, I guess the entry barrier for profession of a screenwriter starts at about 20 IQ, it's no news to anyone.Still, it stays pretty close to source material and world, and since it's just a pilot season, I'm sure future bodes well for ""Reacher"".

I say little because there is one thing (really two) I found baffling: the difficulty Reacher had taking on the cousins.

I did notice a few distracting flaws.The scene with the badass woman defending a dancer in the strip club jarringly made no sense and seemed obligatory towards today's 'woke' society. Similar towards Reacher's defense of a cute dog and subsequent takedown of the owner. These two scenes were so outside the story and contributed nothing except possibly a weak attempt to make our toughest characters appear more human. Also, in the final showdown, as bad guys began falling, their guns lay prime for the taking---yet our heros seemed oblivious to the possible advantage..!But all this aside, I did enjoy it and I am looking forward to a second season.

This show is a stand in a crowd one. I liked the ironical beginning of the movie, as opposed to the one in 1967's ""In the heat of the night"" movie, the masterpiece played by two great actors, Sidney Poitiers and Rod Steiger. In the original, a black cop stops in the middle of the night in a southern town and is picked up for questioning when a stiff surfaces up in town. In Reacher, there's a black sheriff who is questioning a just newcomer in town, a white guy, who is a former policeman. In the original Sidney Poitiers is arested at midnight, here Reacher, the white guy, is arrested in the middle of the day.The directors of the episodes are pro, everything is going smoothly, as if there is just one good director all along.

Its a lowish budget season long action mystery. It has 3 personable leads (its so good not to see 15 leads in a current Hollywood production), some reasonable writing (except 1 episode, see below) and some nicely choregraphed fights. Ritchson's Reacher is very stoic, and it suits him.Episode 1 - (8/10) Started out ok-ish, then by the time we got to the prison scenes with the 2nd guy it got really good. Nice brutal fights, a lot of small funny moments.Episode 2 (9/10) Gets even better. Enjoying the 2 secondary leads (the 2 cops). Again, great action & nice character moments. Plus Kristin Kreuk (From Smallville, which Ritchson also guest starred on) was a great addition. We also got some nice romantic scene with a good music choice to match.Episode 3 (6.5/10) - Not a good episode. The 2 secondary leads felt off. Especially Roscoe. Everyone felt angry and out of character from the first 2 episodes. Plus the story seemed to stall a bit. I decided to check the writer and what do I find ... Its written by a CW Supergirl writer (!!!). Really? All the choices in Hollywood and you pick a CW writer? Lets maybe increase the bar a little shall we? That being said it did get better in the last 15 minutes. So that's why its not a flat 6/10.Episode 4 - (8.5/10) - Back to form again. Everyone felt like themselves. A nice change in locations.

He tries so much to appear smart with all those smart wished lines he has to recite, but completely fails.The script does not at all, it is made to impress retarded people, everyone else needs to be very lenient towards it or it would be impossible to watch the show.The only decent character in the show is the girl, but she alone cannot compensate a bad script and the poor acting on the main character.I wish so much that quality productions would some day reach at least 1%, unfortunately it seems the number goes down every year....",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur8439573/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9288030,ur1881385,6,7 February 2022,"Reacher is actually cast more realistically than the films with a 6'2'' (not 6'5'') Alan Ritchson who can handle his own in hand to hand action sequences but when he starts talking with the contrived dialog of someone who had all week to prepare each sentence and knows everything about anything, the shows believability quickly falls apart. Unfortunately, the producers decided to completely woke-out the supporting cast with the African American Sherlock Holmes ""Oscar"" who went to Harvard and likes rock music. The stereotypical teeny-tiny female police officer ""Roscoe"" who is of course ""tough"" and of course his African American female ex-military friend ""Neally"" who is also ""tough"". After the trifecta of wokeness I finally cringed, since it all felt so forced just to check off the right boxes.To make matters worse, Reacher nonsensically roams around apparently without a change of clothes and only takes public transportation. It literally takes a few episodes for him to stop ridiculously walking around everywhere on foot. Apparently, the producers think small towns in Georgia are all like big cities and everything is within walking distance from the town center in under 5 minutes. It does not help that many of the scenes look like they were actually filmed on fake studio sets and not in the real world. When you look at a production like Yellowstone, shows like this do not even come close.Somehow you have police officers being murdered and none of the main cast which includes fellow police officers worries about wearing body armor or carrying anything but their handgun with a single magazine. After the bodies start falling in the first few episodes, Reacher who apparently knows everything keeps saying he needs a gun but does not bother to try and obtain one from the many places you can in Georgia. He instead ""arms"" himself with a pocketknife from a tackle box ...seriously. Having him grab an older hunting rifle or shotgun off someone's wall or even picked a firearm he needed to clean up from a pawnshop would have brought some semblance of realism to this show. And when he eventually does get a firearm, he is gifted an impractical 7-round Desert Eagle, as if this is a FPS video game and a teenager wrote the script.With all that being said, Alan Richson as Reacher can work with the right script, director and producer, as you do see glimmers of coolness to his character in parts of episodes that make you smile.

(ie: The Last Kingdom, Peaky Blinders, Valhalla)At first clapping eyes on Alan Ritchson (Reacher) I paused, went back to see if what I chose to watch was an animated movie. He did not look real. So that was intriguing. I have appreciated a few laughs. The action is good. However, the acting is robotic. As in: I say my line, then you say your line. Rinse repeat.

It is background noise with the occasional glance up from my phone to view Alan Ritchson's (Reacher) much discussed stature.

Something keeps happening all the time, promoting reset of the attention span and displays a great entertaining value.* The drawback is pretty much everything else about the plot. The story is filled with multiple cliches in each episode. Sometimes there is an urge to simply skip the next 5 minutes, because the following scene is predictable. The character writing is quite poor. Stereotypical grunts and ""baddies"" are dumb, but so is decision making of the heroes. There was no point of writing all of them very high IQ, if that's not reflected in actions. The context of the series implies heavily stressed situation, yet it's not reflected in the character's behaviour. The plot itself relies on several things which make no sense, but at least the writers admitted the nonsense and explained it. The explanation is not plausible, but bonus point for honesty here.Because of the huge writing problem, it's difficult to judge the acting. The characters are often non-believable, and it's difficult to say for sure whether the director told to play that way, or actors are simply too ""wooden"".Overall it's watchable only as long as one doesn't think about what's going on the screen, but overall the show is pretty mediocre.

That's good. Once I finished watching 2nd episode, it was no turning back. I binge watched episodes that followed. It got better and better, and Richtson was Reacher. I am sure there will be a 2nd season like Connelly's Bosch, which is another one of my favorite novel characters. So I will be looking out for the announcement.

This is the first book of the series and Nick Santora really understood the character and wrote the series being true to the book. Don't like when some writers feel the need to change the books when adapting to TV (i.e Lucifer, Game of Thrones), this show is very entertaining and well done.

tt9288030,ur81667243,5,16 February 2022,"Upside is that the man who is more than his looks finally getting a big role in a show that felt like it had overall big budget.Downside is the altering of every possible storyline from the book. It's Amazon so one expects a lot of woke culture references but this is more than that. They mirrored most of the plot lines or character behavious. For example in tv show Reacher tells Roscoe to run for mayor, in book she says she wants to run for mayor. The altering/mirroring of original makes no sense in most cases.The other downside is the story of Blind Blake didnt have a conclusion in tv show. They just straight erased the ending so the story doesnt feel like it made a perfect sense in the end.Reacher is also not a giant gigachad everyone tells him he is a giant gigachad all the time, sure he is big, he is dangerous, but overall he is human(even tho in first book he feels a little bit psychotic imagining scenarious of killing police officers to escape?).But Alan Ritchson perfomance trumps most of the negatives and altering of the plot, i'm not a huge fan of most things Amazon does but i felt aight watching this despite differences with books. If plot changes made sense to me logic wise i would give this more stars, but they dont, there is a lot of wholes with mirrored/altered script and at the end of the day i feel like Lee Child just knew better.",1,2,/user/ur81667243/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9288030,ur53680155,10,5 February 2022,"Cant remember the last time I binge-watched a series in a day. All the characters were perfect. They all crushed it. I'm really hoping they can churn these out pretty quickly.Sad we don't see Roscoe again, I don't think, but given her performance in this, I don't think she will have any trouble finding other projects. I think one of the things they got so well in this series, is that Reacher is fairly stoic, so the other characters have to react to him to create emotion, particularly with their expressions and body language.There is always that, ""Why are you not afraid/worried/self-doubting"" feeling running through the other characters, yet Reacher remains relentless, and a rock through the whole thing. Character development is for everyone else, they all become better people for having him around, but Reacher remains Reacher. The script-writers and the director deserve credit for realizing this and translating it to the screen.Having said that, can't say enough about Ritchson's performance. It wasn't just his size. He got Reacher right in every way, particularly in the context of the first book, where he was just that juggernaut of vengeance. In later books, he becomes a bit more nuanced, and one can't help noticing how well he nailed that ""Man with no Name"" vibe from Clint Eastwood's spaghetti WesternsI don't give 10s particularly freely, but this one deserves it, because it was so anticipated, people had their doubts, and the trailer wasn't the best.More Please!",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur53680155/?ref_=tt_urv

As everyone knows Jack Reacher is such a fantastical character that he couldn't possibly live in the real world. The creators have realised this too and decided that they wouldn't bother with changing the tone of the books and to keep it set it in its fantasy world, and to their credit that's what makes this work.Ritchson is well cast and grows into the role after a bit of a wooden start in the first few episodes. Goodwin as Finlay and Fitzgerald as Roscoe ably assist, as do just about all the rest of the cast. The production team did a great job and some of the sets felt like they were picked straight out of my head.

tt9288030,ur39887413,5,5 February 2022,"I'm sure fans of the Reacher books will either love this or hate it. The number one complaint on the Reacher Facebook page is Tom Cruise was too little to play the character the way he was described in the books ""A big hulking 6'5"" behemoth"". So, they went out & got one to play this part, and that was fine but they annoyingly had to show the guy with his shirt off no less than 10 times.It's an 8 episode series, it would have been better at 4 or 6 episodes. It's formula TV. They take too many short cuts, by that I mean they get from point A to Point G without going through B-F. A character is able to get into the villain's headquarters as easy as pie. Reacher beats the daylights out of at least one jerk in each episode. Another thing I didn't like was Reacher is just too smart. I mean waaayyy too smart, he knows everything about everything. ""Two nights ago the moon would have been over there and this would have been dark"" Yeah, right. He found a guy that everybody was looking for who was missing for 6 episodes, in 3 minutes. He used his famous Reacher ""logic"". He's just too cool, too smart, and too huge.Now the good parts. There were some good scenes. The soundtrack is the bomb. I loved it. Great Blues tunes.

tt9288030,ur64346381,8,9 February 2022,"To preface, this show is my introduction to Jack Reacher as a character, so I'm watching this with 0 knowledge on the character and I'm glad because this show made one hell of a first impression of who Reacher is.TLDR at the bottomReacher takes us through 8 episodes of pure entertainment. It follows our protagonist being arrested for a murder he didn't commit and then getting himself tangled up in a whole mystery of what's happening in Margrave, and through the 8 eps, not once did I think the show was dragging. That's saying a lot considering the action scenes weren't as much as I expected and nowhere near long enough to what I had wanted.The show felt fast paced and heavily bingeable for 2 reasons, the writing and the beast of a man that is Alan Ritchson. Ritchson bodies this role as the quick witted, blunt ex-soldier, think BBC's Sherlock meets Thad Castle, and his dynamic with Malcolm Goodwin's Finlay is gold. Whilst you may be forgiven in thinking you'd get annoyed at Finlay for always being against Reacher, it was their chemistry that shines as they bounce off each other. The same is to be said when you put Willa Fitzgerald's badass Roscoe in the frame. The three of them together sparks some of the best dialogue in the show. We have to appreciate the humour in this show; it doesn't take itself too seriously.Like I said, the action sequences were great but so short, most less than a minute, but the writing that takes us through each scene that leads up and trails away from the action is to the point, succinct and keeps the narrative moving. It does have some emotional beats now and then which is okay and definitely gets better as the season goes on, but these moments don't really linger, and it kept the pace high.However, the fast pace is also to its detriment - literally. Sometimes the dialogue is said so quickly you miss what they say, and it comes across convoluted and confusing, I found myself having to rewind it a couple times to catch the info they're putting out. It was so quick even the subtitles were overlapping each other sentence to sentence (could just be a subtitle error). We have to also remember quicker doesn't equal smarter.There is some sort of predictability in the show but it's nothing to take you out of it at all, it's a show that doesn't focus too much on the suspense and mystery element but more on the moving to the next moment as soon as. And that's what this show was, a moment-to-moment play, there was no big epic moments, bar one perhaps, where the score gradually increases as the fight reaches the climax to increase tension, this included the fights with named characters, and to me this was a breath of fresh air. We just move on and get to solving what's going on.P. S. I'm glad the flashbacks were kept to the minimum; they told the story they had to tell without bloating the main narrativeP. P. S. I appreciate any show with a hitman style sequence, especially when it isn't so slick and in character.TLDR: Great show, great intro to the character but has with minor gripes.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur64346381/?ref_=tt_urv

Third, Alan Ritchson is the best on screen representation of Jack Reacher to date. Although he's not as big as Child have described the original character, he's finally big enough and quality scene setting makes him even more appealing. To conclude, this is by the book Reacher.

After watching Banshee, I came straight to this one and I confess I can't take it anymore. Here we have another slapstick action, but this one is much more subtle than the previous one.This series manages to be even less dramatic than the last one we recommend, but it is less forced in the slapstick aspect. It still refers you to the action movies of the 90s, since the protagonist is a closet.Alan Ritchson (Reacher) is not very expressive, which takes some of the shine out of the whole thing, but the series suggests that the character is too.

I may start after devouring the 1st season of this show.Alan Ritchson, who plays the title character, was a complete unknown to me like most of the rest of the outstanding cast. Wow, he make an immediate impression when you first see him. Think of The Terminator,--only taller-- without the cyborg interior. The show uses his imposing presence to maximum effect. Fortunately, he has a very dry sense of humor that barely registers because it doesn't need to have its effect (think of Michael Shannon in ""The Shape of Water"").Willa Fitzgerald & Malcolm Goodwin play his main allies & give increasingly great performances as the series goes. This a very smarty written show.It delivers the all of the action tropes you look for in this kind of show. The fights are brutal (Bourne-worthy), some of crime scene shots are very gruesome. This isn't a show for weak stomachs (but it doesn't linger on the gore either).All in all this the most fun I've had watching a show since the 1st season Jack Ryan &, of course, all of Bosch.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur38324419/?ref_=tt_urv

Because of the I was on pins and needles, because I did not want to see some of the characters to end up dead and that suspense was intense for me to the very last action sequence.What I found refreshing is that this is a story about a red blooded American hero with traditional values of honor and honesty. The development of these tradition values is told in childhood flashbacks. That is part of the reason I liked the show.The cast is excellent, which is why I grew attached to some of the characters. If you watch the show, you will see what I mean.

Yes, if you are a huge big strong guy with military training you probably win a fight against anyone, and yes, sometimes black guys are allowed to play the bad guy and the white guy can play the good guy. Yes, slim female characters can be be strong and powerful in spirit and demeanor without having to unrealistically beat ten guys, just because of woke s$%#.The characters seem on point so far, I am curious about a second season. Would love to see it being more dark and mysterious, though.Here is something I don't like:
I think Reacher could have been even more unresponsive and non emotional or maybe more tormented, something like, Marv from Sin City, but hey that's just my opinion you don't have to agree.

He roams across Americas cities and towns with only the clothes on his back and a toothebrush; busting heads when its' appropriate while miraculously solving murders and exposing conspiracies. He's like the All-American white bread super hero with t-shirt and jeans.I'm 3 episodes in of season 1 and it's based upon Killing Floor the first in the series but takes liberties prolong the suspense over 8 episodes instead of 4 at the most and I assume Lee Child was ok with that since he exec-produced all 8... They should observe the BBC's very succesful Vera (now in its 11th season) series - 90 minute productions and every one cut and dried.In the books Reacher is a no nonsensce big guy and women admire his intelligence, morals.

Naturally, I had already watched the Tom Cruise version before reading the books, and liked it well enough (despite not really knowing too well about the height issue fans complained about).So, when I heard Amazon was going to make a Reacher series, I was skeptical. I'm so glad I was wrong. Alan Richman plays Jack Reacher wonderfully. The first season, although a slight departure from the novel's 1st person perspective, and understandable from a story telling standpoint, was very faithful to the story and even feel of the novel. They really brought Margrave to life, and the mystery and sinister of the plot worked well on screen. The acting, writing, pace, and direction was all superb, and ending episodes on a cliffhanger (despite knowing the story) kept me in full binge mode to where I watched all episodes in 2 days.I enjoyed the show about as much as the book, and cannot wait for season 2. I really hope they continue with the rest of the books, as long as Amazon, Alan, and Child will allow. If it can continue for longer, I'll definitely say with fill confidence that this is my top streaming show. 100x better than the Tom Cruise films, and I'm not saying they weren't good, but Tom just doesn't *feel* like Jack Reacher (after revisiting post-books).",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur2725774/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur28146936,8,22 February 2022,"Well, after the unmitigated disaster that Amazon's ""Wheel of Time"" fanfic was (it certainly wasn't an adaptation), I was a little hesitant to check out another ""book adaptation"" of theirs. Fortunately, I ended up being very impressed.Having never read Lee Child's Reacher series, I enjoyed the Cruise films, though I did learn later how unhappy book fans were with his depiction of the character. This Reacher, Alan Ritchson, is a big man and seems, in my layman's eyes, to be a great fit for the character. I, personally, very much enjoyed Reacher himself, whose expertise and prowess in everything might let him approach the status of a Mary Sue... but I'll let this one slide. The ladies want him, and the men want to be him; he's almost larger-than-life. And there's nothing wrong with that.I also greatly enjoyed all of the supporting cast, and had a great time seeing Currie Graham as Kliner.Most surprisingly, there isn't anything unsightly that would make one's eyes roll. Sure, there is the occasional hint that all Southerners are belligerent -ists of various kinds, but that's easy enough to overlook and the show doesn't attempt to force-feed you and political opinions. I'll take it.The story is sensible enough, though some twists are predictable, and one of two moments are outright silly (""enhancing"" a photo of a mortal wound to reveal ""micro-lacerations"" that conveniently depict the shape of the murder weapon in a very obvious manner, for example), but these are few and far between, whilst the majority of the content involves interesting characters, fun dialogue, and decent action.Long story short, I greatly enjoyed this show, and hope it was a good adaptation of its source material. I imagine it'll get a second season, and hope that one also faithfully adapts a book (which, again, I hope this one did).

tt9288030,ur1766474,5,12 February 2022,"When he film ""Jack Reacher"" came out several years ago, the major issue people expressed was that Tom Cruise bore no physical resemblance to the character in the book. Well, in Alan Ritchson you have an actor who is very close in appearance to the Jack Reacher described by Lee Child. Unfortunately, all that did was highlight the fact that surface is not substance.Not that Ritchson is bad- he's actually quite good as Reacher, as are co-stars Willa Fitzgerald and Malcolm Goodwin. The overall problem, which becomes very clear as the 8 episode season progresses is that the 8 episode season is the wrong format for the material. The Reacher novels are thrillers, and thrillers are not dramas, mysteries, puzzles that can be filmed in chapters. Thrillers are primarily about pacing, the steady, page-turning acceleration to the final good-vs-evil confrontation, which the Cruise film id exceptionally well. Here, doled out in 8 episodes, the pace of ""Reacher"" (even if you binge) frequently stalls, or seems out of synch with other episodes, and is hampered by an overly complicated plot device, one that is not re-aligned by the periodic fight scenes, not assisted by long passages of frequently awkward dialogue that is often delivered so quickly that it barely registered, nor is it helped by the gratuitous inclusions of Reacher's former army buddy and his interest in a neglected dog. (Okay, I'll give a pass on the dog. I'm a dog person.) It is also missing a truly imposing villain. A larger than life hero calls for a larger than life antagonist, and here the villain(s) pales when set against the ingenious casting of Werner Herzog in the Cruise film.I've read a number of the Reacher books and liked some of them (The Hard Way and 61 Hours were probably the best); I even liked the Cruise film and was looking forward to the series, but it was a disappointment on so many levels that I'm not sure I'd be interested if they continue the series.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur1766474/?ref_=tt_urv

Its been a while since I read this book but I think they follow the book ok as far as I can remember. The script is ok, but not great, the fight scenes are pretty good, the viciousness is accurate of Reacher but the CGI in the warehouse fire is terrible. This brings us to Reacher himself and the portrayal is ok, but I have two problems first he is to good looking, he is the Hollywood version of Reacher and while the book Reacher isnt ugly he isnt this stylized version. My second problem is that while the fight scenes are pretty good, and acted in themselves, what is missing is that rage feel you get from the books. The Reacher in the books isnt just brutal he is rage personified, when he fights he fights like an animal, for his life. This is something that Ritchson just cant give the character and its what an actor like Denzel Washington or Christian Bale can. I would have prefered an actor like Liev Shrieber or Vince Vaughn but I guess they are to old and not beefy enough, but being Reacher isnt all about muscles its about a guy who not only will beat you to death but who will still hate you when he has, thats the real Reacher his enemies meet and that is why he is a guy to be feared. Cruise actually did a pretty good job portraying this, but there is only so much a guy being 5'7 can do.

Reacher in this portrayal seems like a psychopath. In the books he is arrogant and very smart, but in this show he is also ""off"". He has zero affect and seems like he has something wrong with him. At first I thought they were presenting him as Asperger's or on the spectrum but that was not it. They turned him into a psychopath and that is disappointing.Frequently his deductions were not believable, they were clairvoyant. That was stupid and ruined credibility.The series dragged, it was three episodes too long.Many of the supporting actors were just terrible. The money guy was awful.

I get what other people are saying how he is true to the book version of Jack Reacher, but that just makes me not want to read any of the books. Sometimes changing characters from the book description is better... take Forrest Gump for example. Hanks' portrayal of Gump was way more appealing than the book version. The other main characters were contrived and almost comical which came a cross as bad acting. Alan Ritchson was so stiff. It was almost as though he was trying to do an impersonation of Clint Eastwood. I would have preferred to have seen John Cena in the role of they wanted to keep the character huge. Even Dwayne Johnson may have saved the series if you can overlook the brown hair and eyes. Even so the storyline dragged on.If the storyline was based on the novel Killing Floor and the movie was based on One Shot, why was there so many similarities?

So Ritchson definitely looks the part. And we're reminded of it by a slew of height jokes, some welcome levity with a slightly wooden lead actor and a standard story.Reacher, an ex-military drifter strolls into a small town and immediately arouses the suspicion of the locals and the fuzz. If it sounds like Rambo, yeah. But imagine Rambo as a quiet observer, astute, keenly aware, and intelligent-like Sherlock Holmes. But perhaps he's too smart for his own good as trouble seems to seek him out despite his logical prowess.I was torn whether or not to root for Reacher because one could argue he's an antagonist, a ruthless killer who fights dirtier than any of his foes. His mastery of psychological guerrilla warfare turns the tides in his favor when he's outnumbered or outgunned. While he usually has reasons to regulate the bad guys, sometimes he does so impulsively.Moral ambiguity aside, Reacher has some remarkable action sequences and ties in mystery with some romance and drama. The characters are well written and the story doesn't meander too much to pad the length. It feels satisfying to watch a tactless Reacher march into injustice and correct it with his fists.

He is Military Police; You can't tell if his shoulder boards or sleeve braid are the right color (Green with Yellow trim), but the service cap he is holding has no branch braid at all. 3).

There are Millions out there who could help you get your uniforms credible!

When the Reacher movie was released, I was elated a bit but disappointed as well because that they cast Tom Cruise as Reacher. No doubt that decision was driven purely to make big money based on Cruise's star power.However those movies left something of a sour taste in many a fan's mouth due to complete miscast of Cruise as Reacher.This series however gets that absolutely right. When you see Alan, you feel as if he was born to to play Reacher. His casting is perfect.Willa is cute as Roscoe, however her supposedly southern accent is a bit off. But she makes up for it with her spunk! Malcolm as Finlay is perfect!Willa and Malcolm play perfect support to Alan and they form a fantastic team. Chemistry between these characters is the highlight of the show.Worst cast in my view is Chris Webster as KJ. He doesn't come across anything as menacing and ruthless as the narrative would have us believe and is not helped by the fact that Chris has an almost kid like face and doesn't exude any menace whatsoever. Is his scenes with Willa the forced ""fear"" on Roscoe's face is obvious because she looks like she can beat him up with her bare hands.Fortunately his screentime is very limited so it doesn't get jarring. As a main villain (?) they should have cast a more seasoned and believable actor.

But instead I got a rude, blunt, sociopath who beats and murders his way to solving a murder. The irony is ridiculous.As much as police chief Finlay was a cliched, box ticking , Malcolm X wanna be, he was my favourite character. Boringly he had an unrealistic and invisible Racism target painted on his back which we didnt need as every white male in this whole programme is a baddy, apart from the lead. YAWN!! All that said, Finlay was actually my favourite character. A comment about him being a black sherlock holmes was actually a great idea. The only character with real depth. But sadly hes a joke character, again the irony is ridiculous.Unfortunately that sad but oddly powerful minority of people ruining TV and the movies for everyone else at the moment also got their grubby little hands all over this too..I could pretend they havent messed with this series if the story was good enough..but its not.I would score a 4 but I did like Finlay..so its a 6.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur19449636/?ref_=tt_urv

I never read the books, so I have no basis for comparison there, but I liked the story & character development of all of the primary characters - which certainly gives us more than the Tom Cruise/Reacher movies that weigh in more heavily on the action side of the equation.

The very last episode when they came in and wipe out the counterfeit ring in their HQ was very anti-climatic. All that build up of sophisticated planning and pulling out all stops to kill people that mess with their operation and showing how tough the bad guys are and it took half of the last episode to wipe it all out with a few assault rifles.....come on !!!!

tt9288030,ur9317733,4,26 February 2022,"Overall there's some decent pieces, but ultimately it's just too over the top, too long, too many murders without the outside world or news noticing, too many ""twists"" that don't matter, too much too much, and FAR too many unbelievable and unnecessary scenes.The lack of any real threats or consequences let's the whole thing down. Stabbed with a knife a few times? OK, have SFX put on a few scratches and call it good. When tons of people are killed (often times in full knowledge of the authorities) it's treated like your average Tuesday (and Law Enforcement does nothing about it, other than enable more violence). It's all so amazingly disconnected from the real world and contrived that it's not even fun.Have one of the good guys die (or at least get injuried), even a small supporting character, as long as we care about them, and it would drastically improve the believability and increase the tension and stakes going forward. Instead it's a zero-stakes fightfest where the many fight scenes all look and feel the same, and certainly all have the exact same outtcome. Rise and repeat in practically every episode.It's been many years since I've read a Reacher book (I've read many), and even more years since I've read the book this season is based on (The Killing Floor) so I won't speak to how faithfully it follows the book, but know that the story as presented here isn't great.It's like the show runners were being paid by the episode, and took what could have been a very tight and tidy story told across 5 episodes and stretched it out to 8 by bloating it with unnecessary stuff. Why kill 1-2 bad guys when you can kill 4-5! And then do that 5-6 times throughout the season! There's an unlimited supply of no-name bad guys, none of which can shoot a gun or fight (so makes you wonder what positives there could be on their Bad Guy Resume to get them hired?)The acting is a mixed bag. A few of the actors are good (and do the best they can with what the script gives them) however about half are terrible (like high school play quality level). Alan Ritchson physically makes a good Reacher (WAY better than 5'-7"" Tom Cruise), however his acting is pretty mediocre. I get that Reacher is a man of few words and even fewer emotions, that's not the problem, Ritchson's delivery of his lines are just so stiff/deadpan and leaves a lot to be desired.Malcolm Goodwin overall does a pretty nice job, though a little too ""emote to the back row of the theater"" at times. Tone Goodwin down 20% and Ritchson up 20% and it would be a HUGE improvement. Willa Fitzgerald overall does pretty consistently poorly, though there are some scenes she nails. Chris Webster is a caricature and his acting is ""small suburb community theater"" worthy.Maria Sten's acting isn't great, but boy is she given a pile of poo to work with script and story wise. Bruce McGill, Leslie Fray, Martin Roach, Mark Bendavid, Harvey Guillen, Patrick Garrow, and Currie Graham all do good-to-great jobs in their supporting roles with Kristin Kreuk and Willie Carpenter probably being the top 2 standouts. Overall, I found that the smaller the role the better (and more consistently good) the acting was, so kudos to the casting agent that gave some lesser known people their roles, as they almost universally nailed what they had to work with.The action scenes are generally well done, though more fitting for a superhero movie where the good guys can't be hurt and always overpower the bad guys. The biggest problem with the action is there are way too many hand to hand combat scenes considering this takes place in the Southern US and involves a TON of bad guys. But even when the bad guys are armed, they don't hurt the good guys, noooo, they explain their whole nefarious operation and then hold on to them unharmed until they have a chance to escape/be rescued. (The infrequent times where the bad guys are armed, they have Storm-trooper level shooting skills!). The best thing to say about the bad guys is they each are kind enough to make sure that the person they wronged the most, is the only person allowed to hurt/kill them. Evidently the people behind this show feel you can't have ""closure"" unless the correct good guy kills the correct bad guy! And amazingly the bunch of good guys spread out just enough that they pair up perfectly with the bunch of bad guys, that also were kind enough to spread out!The cinematography is good, the sets are very nice, and the music is refreshingly different than standard TV fare (though I would've preferred a little more integration of the blues music with the actual soundtrack and not just used as ""what's on the radio"" music). However, there are just too many unbelievable, contrived, makes no sense but we'll do it anyway moments. Don't want to get shot? Just drop your head 2"" below the top of a cardboard box and when the bad guy shoots the top of the box 6"" from your head (and angled directly towards where you're hiding) the cardboard will stop the 3 bullets!There ARE some fun scenes and some entertaining parts, but the whole show would have been vastly improved if the total runtime was under 5 hours instead of the bloated 6.5 hours. Cut out a trip to NY and that entire useless story-line and a few less ""Reacher is outnumbered by a group of unarmed assailants with zero fighting ability other than their patience in waiting their turn to attack"" scenes and what remains would get a few more stars (7.5* territory) and be recommendable. As for future seasons, I think they need to seriously consider shorting the number of episodes (down to 5-6) or doing 2 books per season (which probably would require a 10-12 episode season). 4-5 hours of runtime per book would translate to a much better finished product.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur9317733/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur0751837,4,5 February 2022,"Back in the 1980s, action movies featured simplistic plots about impossibly muscular heroes who shrugged off numerous bullet and knife wounds, while singlehandedly overpowering a platoon of heavily-armed bad guys, before killing the head honcho in spectacularly gruesome fashion, then quipping a zinger line.And with Reacher, we're right back there, and it's not necessarily a good thing.Let's start with the titular hero and the actor playing him. Alan Ritchson is a big guy, who has obviously worked very hard at the gym; he's absolutely shredded. Yet, we're supposed to believe that this is a man who wanders from place to place, eating bad food from diners and fast food joints, and whose only exercise is beating seven shades of what's-good-for-the-roses out of bad guys. Good genetics and a fast metabolism can only suspend disbelief so far.Then there's the writing. What passes for back story has Reacher unapologetically beating up anyone who breaks his moral code, a trait that continues into his adult life, apparently without any serious legal consequences. The main plot has no nuance and is ladled with heavy-handed foreshadowing; the supporting characters are stereotypes and most are so thinly fleshed out as to be 2-dimensional.All that said, the show is not without its moments, and offers lots of spectacularly staged violence, if you're a connoisseur of such things.If Reacher gets a second season - and on this showing, that's a big ""if"" - they need to give Ritchson much better lines, improve the plotting and give us more rounded supporting characters.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur0751837/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur103966194,9,21 February 2022,"I watched the season on Amazon and then went back and reread the 1st Reacher book, Killing Floor, on which it was based and which I hadn't read in over a decade. Not 100% consistent with the book or its characters, but I can definitely see why Lee Child was an executive producer on the series and did a cameo in episode 8. This was VERY much more Jack Reacher than the Tom Cruise movies.In the books, so much of Reacher's demeanor and character stemmed from his size and military background. And unfortunately for Cruise, you simply can't teach 6'5"" (although, in fairness to Tom, Alan Ritchson isn't 6'5"" either, more like 6'2"" and change...but an elevator shoe insert can do a lot more with that; you just can't make Tom Cruise tall enough without CGI). If you've read the books, Reacher is taciturn, and Ritchson can pull off Reacher just standing there; Cruise couldn't.I can't give the 1st season a 100% rating, but some of that has to do with the original storyline from the book, which is now over two decades old and had to be modernized to place it in a contemporary setting. Some things just didn't translate perfectly. But I binge-watched the 8 episodes and will watch season 2 just as eagerly. Also, some of the rest of the casting threw me slightly, especially for detective Finlay and officer Roscoe, but this wasn't a significant issue; the acting was fine. The second book in the series is Die Trying; hope they decide to keep the order for season 2 and do that one.

Premiering on Amazon where With the Jack Ryan show, failed Without Remorse film, and the upcoming The Terminal List with Chris Pratt Amazon is centering itself as the foster home for mid budget action thriller that are disappearing from theatres.Always heard how author Lee Child was let down by the Tom Cruise films mainly because he doesn't look like the way Reacher is described in the novels. Normally you can get away with new visual iterations (unless you're the Uncharted movie) but in this case Tom Cruise was the complete opposite of who Reacher is. So I was convinced to hit play on this series and the moment Alan Ritchson stepped out like a Terminator built by Greek Gods I knew we were in for prime actioneer goodness.Ritchson has had success as Hawk in ""Titans"" and as a CGI Raphael in the abandoned recent ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" series. A solid supporting actor in both, but here he commands the screen in ways only legends of action like Stallone & Schwarzenegger were able to. Feels like a role he was born to play. Nothing at all like Cruises Reacher, yet so much better. Interesting in the past decade Tom Cruise tried to start 2 new franchises in ""The Mummy"" & ""Reacher"" with both going up in flames. Just stick to the impossible mission Tom.The plot of Reacher season 1 feels very similar to Jean-Claude Van Damme's ""Hard Target"" only taken much more seriously. It may be 8 hours but treated itself with the pace of a feature even the cuts to each new episode were just continued shots from where we left off. Keeping us synced into the storyline.Strolling in like a modern day Cowboy saving the town and walking off into the sunset used to be an outdated premise used to death in the 50s and 60s western.

Unfortunately, it then fell victim to the ""oh, let's just change a few things and make it better"" syndrome which, given the American mindset, usually means it's worse. About episode 5 it begins to go downhill.They left out two of the most poignant parts of the book, the reason why Blind Blake was important to the story and the revelation that the Reacher boys' mother was in the resistance during the second world war and killed someone who would have betrayed her (at age 13 if I remember rightly). Those two episodes, esp Blind Blake, considerably deepened the story, the plot line, and the character development. And there was definitely room to include it.There was no real reason to kill off Kliner and add in the Venezuelan gangsters and make them and the psycho son of Kliner the main killer. There really was plenty of time to leave the book as it was and just make a screenplay from the book itself. There is a reason why Lee Child sold millions of copies of the Reacher series and why few have heard of the screenwriters of this series.The actor was fine in the role in terms of size and appearance, which Tom Cruise was definitely not. The initial episodes, he was fine, but begin to lag as time went on. He did not have the requisite intensity of Cruise, something Reacher in the book has. I don't put this down to his acting since he did fine in terms of intensity in the initial episodes but rather to a combination of the direction and the worsening script half way through.It could have been much better but failed, as all too many do, from regrettably American tendencies common in both the film and television industry (shallowness, mental deficiency, and an unfortunately misplaced belief in their own capacities as storytellers . . .

-Generally respects the source material in character representation and story.-Exceptionally well choreographed and edited fight scenes (some of which are practically taken right from the pages of the book, which is cool). Perfect balance of realism and visual impact. I actually find them to be superior to many big-budget action movies, and this may be the best part of the series.-Good cinematography, looks and feels high-budget.-Limited political preachiness (although it's not nonexistent), which is a rarity in modern entertainment.-The show is genuinely entertaining despite it's weaknesses, which is why I'm giving it a 7 rather than a 6.The bad:
-The acting is mediocre at best, and even some of the more accomplished actors feel wooden, which brings me to my next issue:
-The writing. The dialogues are not only clichéd and clunky. They really feel the need to spell everything out for you. For example, all of the villains brag to each other about horrible things they do, make obviously racist or sexist remarks so the audience knows that they're really bad guys. You won't find an intelligent and complex villain like Gustavo Fring in this series. In summary, the writing lacks subtlety and maturity.-The flashbacks are silly and kill the mystery behind Jack Reacher.-Both the male and female characters sometimes have a Captain Marvelesque smugness to them and the corresponding invincibility that makes them uninteresting.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur90796537/?ref_=tt_urv

But we all like to see a big, tough guy battle evil. In fact, it's a proven formula. The show would have benefited from a technical director to avoid mistakes like poor firearms choices, ie: the Desert Eagle that never needs a reload. Or declaring a 95 grain 9mm ammo is subsonic when it's heavier bullets such as 147 grain that slows down enough to be mechanically suppressed. And the girls handcuffed above their heads who decide to just slide the cuffs down the yellow pipe when the scene called for them to make eye contact. But so what. It wasnt even remotely believable, but it was entertaining when compared to to the woke crap being put out everywhere else. I thought Paul Warburton would have been a better choice for Reachers brother Joe as they actually could pass for related. Unlike the model/actor Christopher Russell who looks nothing like Reacher despite the storyline where Joe's girlfriend mistakes Reacher for brother Joe while she is dying. Richtman does a good job as the quiet brooding Reacher character but all I could think was if we weren't looking at a future Terminator remake star.

In the books JR is a 'hit first, talk second' kind of guy. He takes way too long to take out his opponents in the show.

Bosch is a gritty, true(r) to life crime drama with a veteran detective as the hero. It's a dark (but not too dark) look at true crime. Reacher is a fun, over the top action series with an oversized ex military cop who believes in true justice no matter what it takes.

I get the impression that Reacher, played by Alan Ritchson, is too pretty and too gym fit to perfectly resemble the character as envisioned by the books' author: in the books, Reacher's sort of attractiveness is more visceral and rugged--like a Timothy Dalton, or even Stacy Keach, sort, and his fitness is less that of the gym rat and more that of the constantly moving, constantly exerting, pit fighter.But Mr Ritchson is a far better representation of the best-selling series' main character than Tom Cruise, who portrayed him in two Hollywood movies (which I enjoyed, but...). Cruise is a gymnast to Ritchson's prizefighter, and that prizefighter is closer by leagues to the desired result. It's a pretty good fit.I enjoy the writing, pacing, chemistry between the leads, and soundtrack. Had I never read most of the books, I'd still be happily watching.

tt9288030,ur62378936,7,16 February 2022,"I'll preface this review by saying that I am not at all familiar with the character, or the book/s that this show is based on. I have not seen the Tom Cruise movies either.What made me interested in this show was the high rating and the lead actor, whom I had seen before in the Titans TV show and thought he was one of the better characters in it.I'll get the score right off the bat, it's nowhere near the 8.4 that it boasts at the time of writing this review. However, it's a solid 7 and it could be bumped to a 7.5 - 8 if the next season fix the shortcomings of this one.This is one of those shows that doesn't want to be complicated. There are no layers in the story, no complex twists, no high mind concepts etc.No, this is ""bad guy bad, good guy good, good guy wants to kill bad guy because bad guy killed someone close to good guy"".This constitutes the bones of the story.The meat of story comes from the Sherlock-esque investigation conducted by Reacher, Finlay and Roscoe. It has a good number of plot holes and plot conveniences, but the show does something(probably unintentionally) that detracts from those. Before you have time to think why it's a plot hole...CUT, action scene, GUNS etc.Story is by far the weakest aspect of the show, but it's simple enough that you can forgive it for that.The dialogue is...frankly all over the place. Yes, it sounds smart at times, but it's probably not helped by the wooden delivery. And it's quite the paradox because the actors seem charismatic through the body movements and gestures but when they open their mouth, sometimes you're kinda left scrathcing your head.But enough about the script itself, it's an action series, so the action must be good right? Right?Um...yes and no.It's not bad but it's inconsistent, hence the yes/no.Reacher is by all intents and purposes, AN ABSOLUTE UNIT. He sometimes fights 2-3 people at once and wins hands down but then gets almost killed by a skinny dude. It's weird.The scene at Hubble's house where our mystery killers fall in the trap of Reacher had the potential to be perfect...were it not for the last part.It showed good usage of tactics, diversion, target acquisition and disposal,stealth, weapon usage...and then he almost gets killed by the skinny dude with a crowbar.COME..ON.The ending fight was also cheap...typical warehouse assault 4v 16515649641 where nonoe of those goons can shoot straight.Is it really that hard to build a skilled antagonist or team of antagonists and resolve the final fight via pure tactical prowess, with real stakes?Lastly...characters.Reacher was good, despite the wooden dialogue, he was fine.Finlay was likeable, a bit of overacting at times, but still, good enough.Roscoe was...surprising. Good to see the damsel in distress trope not used here.Neagly was good.Picard was ok, although I saw the twist coming a mile away.The other bad guys however were cartoon villains. Empty threats and ""ooh...look at me I'm dark"" facial expressions.So...I said the show was a 7.Suggestions for season 2 in order to make it bump up to a 7.5/8?Keep the simplicity, but try and eliminate the plot holes. Make the action consistent, even if that means Reacher won't take on a tank next season. A good antagonist with a comparable skillset that gets defeated by Reacher being smarter is better than a full asault on a warehouse.",1,2,/user/ur62378936/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9288030,ur64553658,9,24 February 2022,"As a fan of the books, I was impressed.The first season is a faithful adaptation of the first book in the series ""The Killing Floor."" The casting was spot on for all of the characters.The actor who was cast to play Jack Reacher is the right size, build, and looks exactly like he is described in the books (as opposed to Tom Cruise in the films). Alan Ritchson plays the character perfectly. He speaks, acts, thinks, and has the exact mannerisms of the Reacher of the books. His characterization alone would have been enough to give the show a positive review, but the plot of the book is also faithfully adapted and paced well, the action is well done, fighting well choreographed, and the other characters are cast correctly with good actors playing them faithfully. I absolutely loved it.The only reason I'm not giving this show a 10/10 is because there was unnecessary nudity in several episodes. I know it has a rating of TV-MA, but as Daredevil showed the world, a show can have a TV-MA rating and have realistic violence without needing to include nudity or gratuitous language and still be an incredible show. Implication and lead up followed by aftermath rather than showing nudity can go a long way and make a show that appeals to a larger audience.Otherwise, the show is excellent and I look forward to seeing them adapt another book for the second season.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur64553658/?ref_=tt_urv

It was good to see the book come to life in this series that imo was well produced and made across the board.

A Sherlock Holmes when it comes to solving mysteries. Prime's Reacher is all that but unfortunately the actor fails to humanized, for lack of a better word, his character. Watching the first episode, my girlfriend thought Reacher is animation, produced by a computer program. He is like a robot, something like the Terminator. (even Terminator could spark some emotion).Compared that to The Witcher, he starts the first episode, talking to a wounded animal.Lee Child's stories fail to attach the events of the books to real world locations, the way Michael Connelly is able to do with Harry Bosch.Prime's Reacher would have benefited from a slower pace, more character development first, before jumping to fight scenes. Instead, Reacher doesnt even talk for a long time to start the first episode.I think I will still watch the series, but I wish they had done more than some smart comments ( is there a man nailed to the wall?) in-between the fight scenes.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur84186127/?ref_=tt_urv

Almost like it is rushed --- People don't really talk like that---- It makes the story harder to follow unless you really concentrate (Almost fell asleep to the monotone)----- SHOUT once and a while!!........ And another thing, I don't need to see reacher as a child--- His mysterious persona is what gives his character attraction------ All we need to know is that he is a badass former military policeman, don't give his upbringing or him in Okinawa. THAT takes away from the mystery of him....... Makes it boring. I was in Okinawa in 1998 and they would not punish some guy for what his kid did....On a positive note, I do like the action and the style followed along the same lines as the movie --- I like the, ""Street Justice"" and I cheer whenever I see it... ---- The nude dead guy was a bit shocking.

A few good action scenes in the beginning. Uninteresting and unrealistic story crime-wise. Fine acting and the dialogue isn't off as such but in terms of the story it's not believable if you're an adult. 250lb violent guy gets to insert himself full time in a murder investigation immediately after getting cleared as a suspect himself and despite not currently being a cop. He basically walks straight out of a jail cell and takes over the investigation from the actual detectives, who just allow it... Because?? He's super smart?? 5 episodes into him playing detective and he still hasn't explained to his colleagues how he coincidentally ended up in the same small town in which his brother was murdered, except for some BS story about him tracking down a blues singer. Obvious lie but nobody has brought it up for days/weeks?? The criminals are cartoonish. Making counterfeit money. Reacher at one point speculates that they're trying to destabilize Panama, based on nothing except for the perps being Hispanic, despite the idea not making any logical sense. How do you destabilize Panama with a criminal counterfeit money scheme? What, through inflation? Or are you going to finance a revolution? What the f are you talking about?

It took a bit of a shocking turn with a very violent and repeated unnecessary displaying of bloody naked male focusing often on his reproductive organs. (My teenage daughter was disgusted and horrified, as was I). Moving on though we wanted to know what was going to happen next so we kept watching. By the fourth episode it was starting to become repetitive and predictable. The gory violent killings never let up. The gratuitous nude shower scene was anticipated and unfortunately expected but added nothing to the plot. (Could have done a lot without actually showing everything). Skipping on we find ourselves at the stomach turning overused ""meeting"" at the strip club with topless slutty women on display all over. 🙄. By the start of the 7th episode I knew exactly what was going to happen, who did it and how it was going to end. I was looking forward to it just ending. The final episode was cliche, predictable and left me not wanting more.* Side note: Can we please get rid of the perverted writers and directors who have pointless shock value nudity. It, 99% of the time, adds absolutely nothing to the overall story line and in my opinion takes away from it because it is unnecessary distracting. Haven't women come further than this?

By about half way, they had not just covered every dumb TV, cop, military, legal, lawyer, nerd-girl, and tough-guy cliché, but invented new ones that will plague us in the future. They summarily suspended believability without delay, and gave zero care about anything connected to any reality. A lawyer who's tough on the cops because of the Constitution but then turns into an illegal slave owner? We gotcha! Tiny little town where everyone knows each other so they harass the stranger they don't recognize? Fo' sho, PLUS...there's more...the town is also big enough to have a convenient huge prison housing top murderers, where they put the known-innocent citizens to let them...something...I still have no idea what that was for, other than creating really bad fight scenes with zero storyline or connection to any physics whatsoever.

But he's also not supposed to be so wide-eyed/savant appearing: he's lived, he's seen & done stuff, y'all. Although the actor playing Reacher is a bit too wooden (& can't they teach action stars how to run & walk?!), there's definite growth potential for him, IMO. He delivers some pretty good one-liners & smirks.... Plus? He soooo purdy & those little-to-no-clothes scenes don't hurt. The remainder of the cast were pretty good in their roles - Bruce McGill as a lion-maned, bumbling bad guy is always a treat. But the new Bad Guy to watch for, y'all?

The protagonist is everything you want from a hero: smarter, better looking and stronger than everyone else on the planet and the ladies love him. He wins every fight and beats every bad guy, while making terrible quips through a cocky smirk. What I would love though, is just to see just a tiny bit of nuance to the villains, a little grey area between good and bad, and a little less glamourising of self-righteous vigilanteism.The main issue with Reacher is the complete lack of depth to the characters and the very black and white moral code. Jack reacher brutally murders dozens of people, many of them just standing guard. He'll strange someone to death and then laugh about it, just as he'll pull someone who's calmly sit in a car unarmed and smash their face in. None of the villains in the series have a tenth of the body count of Reacher or the complete lack of remorse.

I've spent some time thinking about what I'm going to say next, and ultimately, my opinion of these types of shows/films boils down to what they ask of their female characters. Maybe it's subconscious, but I can't get into the shows where the females are either a) complete damsels in distress or b) putty for the hero. In ""Reacher"", both Willa Fitzgerald and Maria Sten are independent, assertive women who do much more than purse their lips while wearing form-fitting clothing. And I'm glad for the inclusion of both, even if we know that Reacher & local cop Roscoe are inevitably getting naked together. I liked the plot; it was creative and interesting. The characters were played well, and I personally was surprised about who turns out to be the true puppet-master. I appreciated that the people with whom Reacher fight are, if not physically imposing, are at least similarly trained to the point where they aren't mere fodder for our hero. About the only thing I'd criticize is the ""humor"", but that's a common criticism I have for these types of series. You're never getting that crass, shocking ""Succession""-style humor in a procedural; instead, you're getting characters having their personal codes flipped back at them, or tongue-in-cheek ""Well around here"" jokes you can see coming a mile away.

Hes great in loads of things, he was being greedy wanting this franchise.Reacher in the book is big. Confident and intelligent too. Though Cruise got 2 of those aspects...he wasnt Reacher because hes 5 foot 4. Throughout the books Reachers size is important.So the new guy Alan Ritchson is big, and beleiveable. I already thought he was great in TITANs...which I never thoguht i would enjoy but it is surprisingly good (and Doom Patrol too, check them both out!).The tiniest criticism is he looks a tad too young. BUT thats nothing. And his voice felt deeper n the books, but again thats barely a complaint tbh. Mr Ritchson exemplifies the character well enough to make me not mind. Oh, If im forced for a 3rd tiny criticism, hes a tad too good looking. Lol. But again, thats nothing and the shows input and effort really makes up for those tiny criticisms.This has been a treat 3/4 way through the series. Many of the scenes in this TV show played out very close to how I imagined it happening in the books. I vividly remember thinking thats jus how it was in the books and in my imagination.The Lady police officer is a great character, and so is the detective. In fact, the casting has been excellent all round. Beleievable and faithful to the books.And there are addiotns to the book that fleshout the series, I am not complaining at all. Its to be expected and ultimately its just more more more of a great tv drama competently made.I am a small blues fan, and an extra golden nugget was the little chats about Blues music.Another thing, is they have deviated from the books slightly to make it more appealing to people who have read the book. I dont mind at all. Maybe some people might not like this, but it just means a few surprising twists for those of us who have already read the books.Keep em coming.

Excellent scenery, cast, and attention to detail.There's obviously a few tweaks to the original story - with reference to more modern technology, a LOT more swearing than the book, and Reacher rarely appears on screen without a cut or two on his face, whereas in the book he hardly took a punch (not very realistic I guess).Very impressed with this.

I was very happy with both, primarily because starting with book one is a good omen for 26 seasons to come!The only change really from the books is that it's current day and not set in the late 90's but aside from that the violence we love Reacher for is there and the only thing missing for me is the 1st person narration - I think in the shows he could have narrated his thoughts e.g. In the diner at the start of episode 1 he looks at the other diners when the cops show up, but in the books he narrates how each of the diners cannot be the intended arrestee and it must be him.

He definitely has the size, and he handled the fight scenes well. It's also a very different look/feel than the movies, which i think is a good thing. Where I was left disappointed was 1) the script and 2) the acting. It was all very B movie standard, and lacked any sense of realism. You can tell that its the same people who make TV shows for CW... i dunno, it just felt silly in parts, with some of the characters being a walking cliche.I do hope it gets another season, and i hope they use the success of season 1 to give it a bigger budget and better writers, as the source material is really good. If they could deliver something more along the lines of a Showtime/HBO series in terms of quality, than a CW one, i think this could be a huge hit.All in all, not a bad start but if season 2 is more of the same, it's probably not for me unless there's nothing else to watch.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur149726831/?ref_=tt_urv

Once you got past the size problem (which, admittedly, wasn't easy), I thought Cruise portrayed the Reacher character quite well: great fighter and better shot; terse, yet funny and flirtatious; rigidly nomadic and spartan; loyal to his friends; merciless to his enemies.Alan Ritchson brings the size everyone wanted, and gets most of the Reacher character. But he speaks in such a monotone, machine-gun manner and fails to make eye contact consistently in a way that made me think they were putting Reacher on the spectrum. The intense gaze that unsettles people is a Reacher hallmark. Ritchson looks more like he's taking an eyecexam. Also, he has a surprisingly short stride for someone his size, so he walks like a robot (or an animated comic book hero). Hopefully in future seasons, he'll loosen up just a little and show a little more charm and empathy.One nagging (and possibly spoiling) goof: In the episode 8 flashback scene where Reacher and his brother go to their dying mother, Reacher gets meticulously attired in his full dress uniform but still sports the same 5 o'clock shadow and unbrushed hair as in the rest of the show.

tt9288030,ur63250566,7,4 February 2022,"To play a character from a novel takes time to establish the 'word' into a 'vision'. I am truly interested in how Thad ( Alan) sees this with the production team.Sean Connery would be a good Jack Reacher! :) The genealogy of portraying a character from a novel is always tough. In Dr No and From Russia With Love, Connery played James Bond from the novel and Ian Fleming wanted David Niven as the perfect Spy, novelists vision versus the actor's is always going to be different. Then Connery switched it up in Goldfinger, as an actor he had given it more substance, life, and aligned with pop culture. Timothy Dalton tried to bring Shakespeare and the grit from the original vision of Fleming. The character was being developed, people's happiness and author happiness and actor happiness. I reckon its a journey of test and measure.Seeing one of the other comments, Reacher does need to walk miles in that body. He is a military man, but with a body of a gym junkie. His size is awesome, but his conditioning of the body is not that of the character, to its fullest extent. As a trainer, I see many bodies, and also Special Forces. I reckon Alan should lean it up a bit, as special forces have a body for endurance and power. That doesn't mean skinny, that means tendons and the ballistic ability to move and lift is more than round muscles. Notice how Alan moves in scenes, a bit restricted.Future seasons I think would be good to see Alan blend into the role showing his own version with the wishes of Lee Child. But just like Ian Fleming and James Bond wanting Niven, which I think would be a disaster, Child will need to work with Alan to create a non-stoppable Reacher, lean and power, wide shoulders and fast legs, more to the books' narrative and voice.Excited about Reacher.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur63250566/?ref_=tt_urv

Admitted it is almost 10 years since I read Killing Floor I think the series follow the book very close. And Alan Ritchinson IS Reacher - no doubt about that.The only two things that are different is that Reacher is a bit too young compared to the book where although Reachers age is never revealed we get the impression from the books that they start out when Reacher is in his start/mid fourties. But no worries - this just makes room for doing all of the Reacher novels over time. The other thing is that the series is brought up to date which means that some of the story line could have been different with today's technology. They are hunting paper trails like in the 90'ties whereas no one today would work with large file cabinets with dossiers or travel around to collect evidence on paper etc.Apart from minor flaws this is as mentioned a very accurate version of the first Reacher novel and we have just learned that Season 2 is signed up.

That being said, while I was at first incredulous that 5'7 Tom Cruise would be cast as a 6'5 Reacher, I thought the movies were good for what they were - they just weren't Reacher.I have a few very mild critiques for the series. I love Alan Ritchson as Reacher but I think his acting could improve a bit (though admittedly, it is difficult to capture a character who is so ""in his head""), and I think he's too buff. Reacher does not spend his days pumping iron at the gym. Hopefully they will back off the 'Mr. Universe' physique a little for Season 2. My next critique may only be because I'm actually from here, but surely the writers at the very least could perform a simple Google search about Memphis? Reacher passed through Memphis a couple of times in his journeys and Lee Child (a Brit) managed to get the details correct. Namely, ""Memphis State"" has been ""University of Memphis"" since 1994, we are not the home to beignets, and I'm pretty sure the MPD doesn't have many, if any, officers named ""Aucoin and Roubideaux"".Many who haven't read the books may not be able to suspend their belief in reality to accept the the over-the-top body count or the overwhelming omnipotence and corruption of a small town's Mayor and police-force, but those characteristics are what makes a Reacher story fun.

Reacher does exactly that; it is like they have lifted the images i held in my head when reading and placed them onto the screen. Ritchson captures Reacher's character perfectly, not only in physical appearance (ok, he's a couple of inches shorter but not a whole foot with Tom Cruise! Plus the direction creates the illusion), but also in demeanour. He's slightly socially awkward, quick thinking when it comes to investigations, and his assessments of people and situations. Add Fitzgerald and Goodwin and i really feel it captures the chemistry of the book. The three work well with their interactions and are instantly likeable.

When Tom Cruise played Reacher in movies I had lost all hope for a proper screen adaptation but this series has definitely given me hope .

tt9288030,ur149651431,4,7 February 2022,"This is my first ever review, but I felt compelled since I had seen so many positive reactions to this show. The plot is fairly entertaining with the various twists and turns in unravelling a very complex mystery. Malcolm Goodwin and Willa Fitzgerald's performances (also Maria Sten as Neagley) were superb; their characters have a lot of depth and I felt emotionally connected to them throughout the show. In short, these characters along with the semi-good plot are the reason I gave it a 4/10. On the other hand, Reacher, the title character, is insufferable. I want to emphasize that I do not believe any of this was Alan Ritchson's fault, this seems to be the product of poor writing. Reacher does not have any likeable qualities, is often condescending, and honestly, never seems to fully recognize that Roscoe is a cop capable of handling her own despite the repeated proof she is a match. Reacher's character never undergoes significant development; the only thing that ""changes"" is how he feels toward Roscoe and yet, in the end, he leaves. So what has he learned through the show? Nothing. He merely demonstrates his ability to kill. If this was combined with character building, I would not mind. But, the show treats Reacher as if he is a hero from start to finish and while he can still be a hero, he is not seen to have any major flaws. Sure, he has emotional detachment, but he is never seen ""letting"" others into his life in a permanent way. (After all, he leaves Finlay and Roscoe in the end.) Additionally, I do not understand why Reacher and Roscoe were emotionally attracted to each other aside from the fact that they were both single and attractive people. If they became friends, that would have been more believable in such a short amount of time (i.e. Maybe two weeks at most). It is clear that Reacher is the personification of ""every man's"" vision of what a kickass solider is and I was definitely not the target audience for identifying with Reacher. If you want a semi-compelling plot with a lead that you roll your eyes at every time he speaks, but is made somewhat bearable due to the excellent side characters, this would most accurately describe Reacher. (P. S. I would absolutely love to see more of Reacher with Neagley because those were the only times he seemed like an actual person and not a killing machine.)",3,25,/user/ur149651431/?ref_=tt_urv

Only issue I have is they did a Netflix and realised all the episodes in one go, I'd rather watch it over 8 weeks, gives you chance to chat about each episode with friends.My final thought, if you liked the movies you'll love the series, bring on the next season.",2,4,/user/ur149653647/?ref_=tt_urv

It's hard enough to adapt a book into a 2 hour-ish movie, but Cruise totally misses the intimidating size of Reacher.Alan Ritchson's Reacher is true to the book in virtually every sense, and the directors captured the intensity, violence, and wry humor that Jack Reacher exudes. The rest of the cast is also excellent, and the mini-series length permits character and suspenseful development. I can't wait for season 2.

tt9288030,ur149694343,10,8 February 2022,"Reacher needed a few specific traits to win over the book fans:
1) size and strength of Reacher (can palm a watermelon/crush a mans head with his hands)
2) adherence to the books
3) minimum dialog by Reacher
4) quick, take no prisoners actionThis series does a good job of nailing these necessities. I will say I have a bit of a man-crush on the actor. He's a beast, and really was fun to watch.I'd say the series gets a 9/10 for accuracy on Reachers traits, as there was a bit more cockiness in the show than in the books, but I give it a pass because we understand we need to keep the attention of a wider array of viewers.The fight scenes are longer and less one-sided in the show, but also probably necessary to keep the action going for the eight hours of show needed to be filled.It's rare for a movie, let alone a series to perfectly match a book, but this was closer and better than I had expected.Some of the ""bad guy"" characters seemed a bit far fetched and obvious, but not so much to lose interest or roll our eyes to.Lee Childs says future video content is dependent on viewer ratings and interest..

Big guy, plays the character well, charm, charisma, funny and violent when needed and plays it very well. Good cast, and the interactions with the main 3 characters were great.

Not read the books but this made me want too and reading that Alan Ritchson would love to make 3-4 books a year and play the character for as long as he his wanted made me want to read them even more.

One of the main characters and one of the main evildoers are connected, but their connection predates the conflict and without that connection, a lot of the plot could not happen. The head of Badguy incorporated is mysteriously murdered and his operation just keeps running, but there is no real motivation for his murder and he has evidently coached up his murderer in all of the details of his operation.A policeman gets murdered at one point, not because he was a criminal who tried to get out or because he was a good guy and a threat, but because maybe he was trying to find out what happened to a missing guy who had not been murdered by the bad guys and who the bad guys actually wanted found and brought in. So, basically, he and his family were just killed to fulfill the RDA of evildoing.I kept thinking things would get better, but it did not. Do not watch until the end.

Sometimes I even fear it. For example, for years I didn't dare to watch the 'Lord of the Rings' film because I was afraid that my image of the world created by Tolkien would be destroyed. Never go back, the Reacher movie with Tom Cruise, cannot be taken seriously. ""A six-pack like a cobbled city street, a chest like a suit of NFL armor, biceps like basketballs, and subcutaneous fat like a Kleenex tissue."" does not describe Cruise in any way. Then they made a much better choice with Alan Ritchson. Maybe just a little too much Marvel superhero (my wife thought he was computer generated at first), maybe just not physically clunky enough, but a very convincing Reacher. The same goes for the series. The atmosphere of the books is captured very well and a lot of attention has been paid to the art direction. The town square of Margrave could easily be in 'The Truman Show'. The acting is good in the other roles (Malcolm Goodwin as Oscar Finley deserves a special mention) and the developments in the series follow a nice pace. Is everything OK? Maybe not everything.

tt9288030,ur25425383,9,7 February 2022,"After nearly 25 years, we finally get to see the Jack Reacher author Lee Child envisioned. Reacher, a brawny mesomorph simply wants to exercise his agency and freedom to go where he chooses and quietly do as he pleases. Although he never seeks trouble, he's never one to back down from doing what's right- principle over passion as one might say.The series follows Reacher through the first novel, The Killing Floor as he is pulled into a whirlwind of crooked local authorities in a small southern town. While there, he discovers he has personal ties to the narrative that forces him to execute what he does best as as retired MP and investigator.SUMMARY: Reacher is not a super hero or crime drama series. I've read a lot of negative reviews comparing it to those genres. If you're looking for a thriller/mystery series that is built around an average guy that executes principle over passion and ""because it's the right thing to do,"" then this may be for you.THE GOOD: Alan Ritchson really nails down the Jack Reacher character in his mannerisms, prosody, and dialog. When he spoke, I felt I was reading from the pages. The supporting cast for the most part also fell into place to support the narrative. Screen writers have near impossible challenges take novel series like this one and translate it to the small or big screen. Nick Santora and team did decent job with a few caveats below:THE BAD: I wish they would have kept the era to the Killing Floor's original late 1990's timeframe. It would have grounded the story a little more to where we aren't stating ""there's no way you could get away with in real life"". The ending was far more hyped up into an action hero climax with gory kills, big explosions, and cheesy non-grounded sequences such as shooting locks off doors and 50 foot head shots. It spoke more Lethal Weapon or Expendables in lieu of Reacher. We also get looks sell. I hope they paid Alan Ritchson a nice stipend for each shirtless scene as well as the diet and other ""supplements"" he most likely had to cycle to prepare for the role.I hope this get's renewed as there are 20+ Reacher novels that would make great seasons.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur25425383/?ref_=tt_urv

Tom Cruise pulled it off on the big screen because his attitude and delivery were spot on even if his physical stature wasn't Reacher-esque. But two hours really short-changes Lee Child's stories.I'm four Episodes into the Reacher series and Alan Ritchson is hitting they key character marks: Reacher becomes momma bear to the good guys and a walking nightmare to the bad guys! A series allows for the story and actors to develop. I haven't read about Ritchson's pre-filming preparation but it feels like he spent time reading the novels. In the books the backstories of ancillary characters are fleshed out only to provide the reader with context, so a shallowness of these characters on screen can be expected.I was expecting to be disappointed, but I'm enjoying the series very much.",1,1,/user/ur25502095/?ref_=tt_urv

Whoever cast it... should be strung up by their fingernails. Tom cruise was not the physical representation of jack reacher, but at least he can act. This guy is like a walking slab of meat who can talk. Every line is delivered like there's a teleprompter in front of him and he's reading off of it. Yeah he's big... but maybe he should have gone into wrestling instead. Having read some of the other reviews that have given this one 8-10 stars, i can see it might be a hit with a large percentage of the reviewers. I guess they're easily impressed and don't care about the acting or the writing as long as there's action. Too bad...there's a lot more to the original character of the late 90s/ early 2000s reacher than just being bigger than the next guy and being able to beat people up. But it doesn't like the producers of this one care about those minor details that actually made it great book series (until the last 4-5 books) and the majorioty of their audience doesn't seem to either....
p.s. For the reviewer who wondered why the actor playing reacher talks so fast...it's because he can't act and can't remember what his lines are so he's just spitting them out as fast as he can remember them.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur3258466/?ref_=tt_urv

We are left with a selfish oaf who seems to think he can do as he pleases and is above any moral code. Reacher literally shoots people in the back.I was very much looking forward to this series and have read all of Lee Child's books. Not only is Ritchson's wooden acting a disgrace, but Santora et al. Seemed to think that they needed to add a good deal of Gore to Child's first novel to make it appeal to viewers. For example, Child describes the horror of the Morrisons' murders by having Reacher hear about the crime scene. He only visits the scene after the bodies have been removed, but in this depiction we get a long look at the bodies as Reacher barges into the crime scene while the investigators are still gathering evidence.In addition to the gratuitous gore that has been added, the producers also felt the need to add a good deal of nudity. The scene in the strip bar was particularly absurd, as was the scene of Reacher and Roscoe's first tryst.Do yourself a favor and stick to the books.

In the first episode, in the prison, all looked fine, but since then he's several times had problems fighting one man. That's not the Jack Reacher of the books. Reacher is not only huge, he's a trained fighter. I can't offhand think of a single time in over twenty books where Reacher couldn't handle one man in seconds. Even men of equal size. Whereas in this series he's several times struggled with men 50lb lighter than him. Okay, perhaps it makes for better drama and extended fight scenes, but part of the fun of the books is knowing that anyone standing toe to toe with Reacher stands no chance. I have to admit, Tom Cruise's handling of five men in his first movie was more Jack Reacher than this. Still, apart from this, I'm really pleased to see the books onscreen.

He walks the Reacher walk, talks the Reacher talk and TOTALY DELIVERS Jack Reacher.I have read every book in the series and while it has been a while, this adaptation tracked along quite well with my recollection of the book. The director did not try and create his own version of someone else's work, he took their work and gave it life.Malcolm Goodwin did an excellent job of portraying Finlay and it took a while for me to recognize him as the detective from I Zombie (another very entertaining series). His chemistry with Alan Ritchson was really one of the keys to making this adaptation so successful.Willa Fitzgerald was great as Roscoe and it is a shame that Roscoe and Finlay are pretty much done with the Reacher world as they do not reappear in Reacher's world for many years.The bad guys are pretty much how Lee Childs wrote them so they are very easy to dislike and want to see them punished and if there is anything Reacher excels at it is punishment.I sincerely hope that Amazon will take this character and do all of the books written in the series. So far this is THE BEST BOOK TO MOTION PICTURE ADAPTATION I have seen come out of Hollywood. There are a few modifications to the book as the book was written with a setting in the 80's and Reacher getting out when the military was downsizing.

They never scratched the surface of all the logic that sat behind Reachers actions. How he planned fights, how he strategises. How he aimed for minimum effort... Getting fights over and done with quickly was the priority.I loved the book one shot. But the film, although a fun action flick, did no justice to the book. The logic and strategy of the sniper.... Wrong (in the book the sniper shot targets coming towards him because it meant minimum effort in aim adjustment between each shot...in the film he has to pan side to side....highly innacurate...a small detail perhaps but it showed a lack of thought). Characters were left out or condensed. And the ending was completely changed from the book. Rewritten for the big screen but losing all of reachers cunning, stealth, and deadliness. Oh, and a random car chase stuck in there for good measure as well.Anyway, enough moaning about one shot.I've just finished reading the book killing floor (,3rd time) so all of this is fresh in my memory.And so many details from the book are there. Reacher will always position himself in the corner to be able to view the whole room. He loves coffee. He loves music. Snippets of conversations, his assesment of Finlay. Teales statue in margrave.A few added extras in terms of dialogue and other bits and pieces also added in. But all in keeping with the theme and fleshing out Teachers character and style.Lots of detail. And lots of action too. The fight sequences are slick, violent, quick, and very ""reacher"". Plenty of the details of the prison fight scene are true to the book. Clearly Lee Child has been closely involved.Ritchson seems to have settled into the role quite well.

They're pulpy thrillers though that are meant to be wolfed down like a bag of nice greasy fast food, not pored over and analysed like some weighty piece of literature, and they work on those terms.

That is really important because that physicality is half the essence of the character, The second half is that Reacher is a man with a mind like a steel trap and you ride along with him hearing the inner dialogue - not easy to portray and so often spoiled by a clunky device like voice-over.To my delight they have got that aspect of Reacher absolutely pitch perfect in this series - I don't really care so much about the plot I just love to watch Reacher in action.

tt13668894,ur2707735,8,10 February 2022,"This series rates slightly lower than ""The Mandalorian"", and it's pretty easy to see why. For starters, it ran for only seven episodes, and even then, The Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal) was a featured guest in the fifth and sixth episode with virtually no input from the title character. Even so, Star Wars fans ought to be pleased, because just like the prior series, it brings to life the texture and feel of the original Star Wars stories beginning with 'A New Hope'. I thought the de-aging tech that was utilized for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in the sixth chapter was impressive and was surprised to see the role he had to play here with the training of baby Yoda Grogu. The story seemed to be full of Easter eggs and references to other films; the business with the spice trade on the desert of Tatooine felt lifted from Frank Herbert's 'Dune"", and when you see the Rancor climb the tower in the final chapter, you can't help but think of the original ""King Kong"". The only real issue I would have with this series is the lack of Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison). By bringing in Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) as his associate, and especially The Mandalorian in the later stages, it dilutes his strength as the main character. Oh, and I was sorry to see Cobb Vanth (Timothy Olyphant) taken down by Cad Bane (Corey Burton), although maybe that scene wasn't as climactic as it appeared. We'll have to wait and see. Peli Motto (Amy Sedaris) was a hoot, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of her in future stories. Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing most of these characters in future stories, as long as they keep in tune with the original spirit of 'Star Wars'.

tt13668894,ur22654354,10,9 February 2022,"Well, of course I gobbled up this series as quickly as the episodes were released. It is a series set in the ""Star Wars"" universe, and it was about Boba Fett, of all characters. And with my life-long love for ""Star Wars"", of course it was a given that I had to watch this.And there was a lot of hype and expectation to creator Jon Favreau's series about the legendary bounty hunter. But did the series deliver? Yeah, I will say that it did. I was certainly entertained, and I liked the episodes, and also the storyline does add a lot of personality to a character that you'd only otherwise really know if you read the comic books and novels. Let's face it, with limited amount of screen time and dialogue that Boba Fett had in the movies, then you didn't really know the character all that well.I found the storyline to be good, and I was particularly thrilled with the storyline that involved the Tusken Raiders, as it totally fleshed out their tribal life and ways of existing on Tattooine. And it made the Tusken Raider more interesting and becoming more than just savage raiders as seen in the movies. And also the Fennec Shand character (played by Ming-Na Wen) definitely was a nice addition to the series, and Ming-Na Wen was very well-cast for this role.As for the storyline for Boba Fett, well I wish we would have seen more from the Sarlacc, as it felt a bit rushed. But in overall, then I was pleased with the story that was written for the character.Season one ran for seven episodes, two of which didn't even have Boba Fett in it, and strangely enough those two episodes were among the best of the seven. That wasn't really a great thing for a series about Boba Fett, that the lack of the main character proved to be among the most outstanding of episodes. That was sort of a shame in my opinion. But yeah, it added depth to the upcoming third season of ""The Mandalorian"".I love how ""The Book of Boba Fett"" is full of easter eggs and things that only the most devout of ""Star Wars"" fans would pick up on. Just sit down and watch some of the YouTube videos detailing these things, there is a lot to delve into.Visually then ""The Book of Boba Fett"" was spectacular. The atmosphere was spot on and caught the ""Star Wars"" essence in a great way. And the props, sets, costumes, creature design, special effects, etc. It was just phenomenal. If you enjoy the ""Star Wars"" universe, then you are in for an amazing ride of discovery.There is a lot of action in ""The Book of Boba Fett"" and spiced up with an equal amount of character and world building. So there is something for every level of ""Star Wars"" fans here.I mentioned that Ming-Na Wen was greatly cast, as were Temuera Morrison. Of course it had to be him for Boba Fett, and it was such a pleasure to watch him reprise the iconic role and character. But ""The Book of Boba Fett"" is filled with great performances and interesting appearances by actors and actresses in every episode.Aside from taking away two full episodes of not having Boba Fett around, then the music was the biggest issue I had with this series. There was no ""Star Wars"" feel to the music, especially since it was blatantly just ripping off ""Ronja Rövardotter"". I could not get into that music, no matter how hard I tried, as it was just so far away from having a ""Star Wars"" feel to it. It felt like something that belonged in a Viking-based movie or series.""The Book of Boba Fett"" is ""Star Wars"" done right, no doubt about it.

tt13668894,ur120966602,7,9 February 2022,"Boba Fett fights to consolidate his position of power within the underworld of Tatooine while reflecting on past events.This is a hit and miss Star Wars show that has some strong moments, but struggles to develop a compelling narrative overall.I'll start positive and say that as a member generation X who grew up on Star Wars, the fan service is exquisite. There are episodes that include great time with beloved characters and quite detailed Easter egg type moments that are equally as cool. This even extends to non Star Wars tributes to movies such as 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'The Godfather', 'King Kong', and numerous Spaghetti Westerns.Contrary to some, I like the Bacta Tank flashback sequences, particularly the scenes set on the Dune Sea involving the Tuskens. Chapter 2 is a solid episode and has the best of these moments.Unfortunately, one problem I find with the character of Boba Fett is that two seasons of 'The Mandalorian' effectively stole his thunder as a cool, armour-clad bounty hunter. As a result 'The Book of Boba Fett' as full series is not necessary and it shows in the fact that he only stars in 5 of the 7 episodes.Another problem is that the writing is quite flat in some episodes and it fails to build any real momentum towards the concluding chapter. Some characters, like the Mods, feel tacked on for marketing reasons and they do not give enough screen time to key antagonists in the early episodes.When the plot deviates for two episodes away from the main events it hurts the overarching narrative, but it's hard not to love where it takes us, particularly for fans of the original movies and Mandalorian. As great as it is, this has an impact on the final episode, which for me is a mess of spectacle and characters.Temuera Morrison is a solid action hero, but is given very little to do other than act like a tough guy with a heart. Other characters like Fennec Shand have good moments, but there are a lot of diversions that don't really allow them to shine.The production values are fantastic in most episodes.

tt13668894,ur13630333,1,14 February 2022,"This rating is based solely on the actual five episodes of Boba Fett 1-4 and 7 content in Season 1. The two ""Mandalorian"" episodes 5 and 6 shouldn't count since the showrunners just shoved in a completely different story to pad the season and give it some semblance of decency. I've been hard on The Mandalorian series and despite the fact that I think it's mediocre, it's way better than whatever this Boba Fett show is. On the Mando show, the writers and directors kept things simple and got to the point. The plot was clear: Mando protects Grogu and goes on sidequests while learning about Grogu's force powers and seeks out Jedi to take the baby off his hands. Of course, this show negated all of that since by the end of it, Grogu is back with Mando, which erases the entire main plot of Season 2 of Mando. But I digress. This review is about THE BOOK OF BOBA FETT.This show is horrible, legitimately one of the worst TV shows I've seen in the last decade. There's not a single thing redeeming about it. It's chock full of bad writing, direction, acting, costumes, set design, and effects. It looks incredibly cheap and fake. On Mando's show, for the most part, the cinematography, design and costumes feel high budget compared to Boba Fett. I digress again, but the comparison is fair since the 2 shows are linked. How do the two Episodes 5-6 look and feel so much technically better for a GUEST character than the other five episodes do for the MAIN character?Speaking of the main character, Boba Fett was written and acted very poorly. He had so much stale and repetitive dialogue babbling nonstop about being a changed man and telling everyone ""I am Boba Fett"" and spending half his time petting rancors and banthas and playing nice with people who tried to kill him. Characters would verbally insult Boba and try to kill him and he would just let them go and actually hire them as part of his security force. And Temura Morrison's acting was BAD, consisting of him growling his lines and doing that ""gritting his teeth"" smiling. It was cringe to watch.The supporting cast wasn't much better. Fennec Shand is this phony badass character that fans think is cool, but there's nothing there. Her dialogue is all monotone exposition. She should change her name to Fennec Obvious. All of the ""badass"" stuff she does is probably a stuntwoman anyway. And I have a hard time buying her beating all these guys that are much younger and stronger than her. There's a such thing as actual physics. Plus, Fennec is a sniper who is supposed to be stealth and stationary. She stays in one spot and shoots people. Why is she always doing flips and weak karate moves that somehow defeat her opponents? Cara Dune (again, I digress) looked like someone who could hold her own against big guys. But Fennec looks silly doing the same stuff.Then there's the awful Teenage Mod Power Ranger characters, led by the girl from the show ""Yellowjackets."" As bad as every character looks out of place, these characters REALLY look like they don't belong in the Star Wars universe. They look like they should be on some cyberpunk movie on Syfy. But the absolute WORST character of the show is that completely unfunny and annoying Mayor's aide ""Tailhead."" This guy is so out of place, he actually retroactively makes Jar Jar seem remotely well-written. I can't believe these characters were even thought of in the first place. The only remotely decent characters were Krrsantan and the casino manager character played by Jennifer Beals, but neither of them were what I'd call standouts.The characterization and plot was thin. Boba crawls out of the Sarlacc Pit in the Pilot and then has these flat bonding scenes and weak Tusken training montages with sticks and speeder bikes. And in all these scenes it was just Boba ""communicating"" with characters who just grunt and squeal their dialogue. Then the writers have this empty scene of Boba crying over these characters after they were killed off screen. Fennec decides to stay with Boba as an enforcer because plot reasons. Since it was already established on Mando's show that Fennec stayed with Boba, the writers were in a bind and just had her stay with him in the flashbacks without any legitimate reason. Once she helped him get his ship back, they should have been square and you'd think she'd want to get back to her life. But nope, she's going to hang with this random guy she just met who has no discernible plan. Also, she's actually got a bounty on her still. Why aren't any hunters coming after her?Out of the 5 Boba episodes, I think Episode 2 had the most positive reaction from fans, but I thought that one was just as bad as 1,3,4, and 7. The gun train scene was so obviously fake with green screens and as cartoonish looking as every other Boba-centric episode. Which leads to plotholes like when did Tatooine ever have gun trains? That feels like something made up just for this show. How can the Tuskens even land a hit from stationary position from something that fast. How could speeder bikes catch up to a speeding train? It's the equivalent of motorcycles catching up bullet trains.And the cosplay level costume design and makeup just made everything worse. At least on Mando's show, it felt like effort was put into making characters seem like part of the Star Wars universe. On Boba's show, the characters like the Pykes, the Trandoshans, the Mayor's aide, really almost ALL of them, looked silly. The Mayor's aide looked like a guy with a prosthetic on his head, because well, it's actually a prosthetic! But it's not supposed to look or feel that way. The Pykes and Trandoshans looked like people with masks on because well, it's actually people wearing masks, not actual alien creatures. Even Jennifer Beals looked pretty silly with the prosthetic head. And of all the characters the writers decide to kill off, they kill her off but not the terrible Mayor's aide or any of the Mods, who are far worse?After the season was officially over, I actually thought if there were anything among the Boba content that was redeemable and worthy of an extra star and I couldn't think of a single thing. Everything was so poorly written and unprofessional. It's as bad as anything I've seen on the Syfy network or Lifetime movie channel or the CW. But it's going to get automatic love from people just because Boba Fett is inexplicably one of the most popular Star Wars characters, but more importantly, because it's STAR WARS, period. I keep reading and hearing conflicting reports if this was a 1-and-done thing or there will be more seasons. Either way, this show is plain awful.",91,124,/user/ur13630333/?ref_=tt_urv

tt13668894,ur23240045,7,9 February 2022,"The Star Wars franchise has always been hit or miss for me. I love the original trilogy and love certain entries in both the prequel and sequel trilogies. When The Mandalorian hit Disney+ a couple of years ago, it was the best thing from Star Wars I'd seen in years. In that series, the character of Boba Fett is revealed to have survived the original trilogy of films and it was very clear that we would be getting more with this character. While I wasn't all that interested, I decided to give the series a shot and although it's messy, I'm still glad I did.Picking up immediately from where the character is left in The Mandalorian, Boba, along with Fennick Shand, is now in command of Jabba the Hutt's old palace. Now the ruler of Tatooine, the lurking of many underworld figures begin to come to the surface. Learning about his past and present throughout the first couple of episodes, I began to get attached to this character more than I thought I would. With that said, I definitely felt there were pacing issues. The first four episodes really felt like they dragged out the story too much, even though not much was happening. Then, many familiar faces show up and the show became something else entirely.Without giving anything away for those who still plan to watch this series later, the latter half of this season takes the focus away from Boba Fett in service of a few other storylines. This felt incredibly odd to me and almost felt like a betrayal to the story that had been set up. However, I couldn't bring myself to complain about it all that much because I truly believe episodes five and six are some of the best pieces of Star Wars content I've seen in a long time (maybe ever). It just didn't belong in this show, even though most of it does serve a purpose.Other than having seen Temuera Morrison in a couple of key scenes in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, we haven't truly been able to witness this much screen time with him, until now. His performance here is great and he added a lot more life and personality to this character. That statement is also a catch-22 in my head though because, as every fan seems to say, the best part about the character was that he was always a mystery (for the most part). Still, I admired his dedication to this role here and everyone around him was also on par. I'd dive into other characters I loved, but that would ruin the surprises.Overall, The Book of Boba Fett started very slow for me, but at least held my attention. Episodes five and six blew me away and I felt the show ended on a pretty enjoyable note, even though I'm not fully satisfied or even sure if they will be continuing any storylines with him in the future. I personally don't need to see more of this, but due to those two terrific episodes, I won't be missing it if they do make more. Overall I thought The Book of Boba Fett was solid, but the rocky start almost lost me. It's better to end on a higher note than you lead with though, right?",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv
tt13668894,ur147091341,8,9 February 2022,"After 7 weeks and much hype and discussion we have come to the end of The Book of Boba Fett and I have watched all of the episodes and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees Boba Fett return to Tatooine and take over Jabba The Hutt's thrown, he now has to deal with the issues that come with power and the enemies that brings.Main Character
Temuera Morrison reprises his role as Boba Fett from The Mandalorian and I personally think he is fantastic. He adds some real intensity and ferocity to the role while actually managing to give the former bounty hunter a character. I really like how he portrays the character and he just fits into the role naturally and I enjoyed learning more about what has happened to him that makes him more then just this cool looking guy who had nothing to do in the films.Supporting Characters
This show had a huge cast and by now I don't think any of them are spoilers so I will talk about as many as I think are appropriate. Ming-Na Wen is back as Fennec Shand and she is also great, I really like the dynamic between the two of them and exploring the duo is one of the highlights of the show. She is also great in the action scenes and I swear that women will never age as she is clearly doing the majority of her own stunts. Pedro Pascal voices Din Djarin and it is great to see him back and seeing how he has progressed since the end of the Mandalorian season 2. He gets way too much screen time but there is no denying that the show does a great job of showing his character at his best. We also see the debut of Krrsantan, a wookie from the comics and it is really cool to see this guy in action and seeing this fearsome more intense wookie on screen is something we haven't really seen before. The rest of the cast are all solid with many cameos that was enjoyable to watch.Story
I really enjoyed the flashback story of seeing how Boba escaped the Sarlaac and made his way to finding Din Djarin in The Mandalorian. I also liked seeing Boba trying to establish a new rule in Mos Espa with this more honourable mentality. I then liked all the stuff involving Din Djarin and some of the wider Star Wars stuff. But the issue is that it doesn't quite work together, all this stuff is good but it feels like 3 different shows at time and I think they took on way too much for the show and it ended up leaving me a little confused as to why the show was called The Book of Boba Fett. The finale delivers though and ends up on a positive note.Script
The script is good, I feel like Boba is a character that doesn't need to talk that much and he still doesn't really but when he does it feels effective. The drama worked for me and the bits of humour is a nice addition. It just feels like Star Wars and that is the job that is required for sure.Style
The show looks fantastic, the budget is huge and the effects are top of the range. Seeing Boba and the other characters in full flight is really fun and I love watching this Star Wars adventure. But there are a few issues, the first one is that after all these years I am a bit fed up of Tatooine and this show is mostly set there and it becomes a bit dull. The other issue is the overall pacing of the show, it links to the story and that so much is packed into the show that at times it loses focus on the story that it is trying to tell.Overall
Overall, The Book of Boba Fett is a great show that has some great Star Wars fun. It has some issues but if you are a fan of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian and Star Wars then this is a must watch for sure.Rating - 8/10.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv

Ever since we got to see boba in other Star Wars content such as TV shows, comics and books. But overall we haven't been able to see much of him as we wanted.With that being said, after his ""rebirth"" in The Mandalorian season 2 and his glorious appearance, it is wonderful seeing him again and learning what he's been up to.The Book of Boba Fett is a great show, it centers around Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) and his new partner Fennec Shand (Ming Na Ren). Together they start their new crime syndicate and level up from being regularly bounty hunters. Throughout the show we get to see flashbacks of boba and his past, as well as moments in the present picturing his struggles to maintain full control of his empire.Viewers and hard-core fans of star wars have been complaining since the beginning of the series that it has depict boba as soft and weak. Not as menacing and feared as he is depicted in the comics.I mean it's a bit obvious to see some changes in his character. It's been a while since we saw him on Tatooine last time In 1983.I guess what fans wanted to see was Boba going beast mode for 7 episodes just like in The Mandalorian season 2. I would have liked to see the same as well, but I'm also happy with what we got.Of course I can understand the fans disappointment, Boba Fett is the type of character that doesn't speak, doesn't take the helmet off, has a mysterious background, you know nothing about him. With all that taken off what are you left with?Fennec Shand is also an interesting character that we know nothing about her, this series could have dived in deeper into her background but it missed the chance.The Mandalorian a.k.a Din Djarin, has stolen the show for the most part, not only him but every other interesting character that appears in this series steals the attention: Black Karssanten, Cobb Vanth, Ashoka, Grogu, Cad Bane, even Luke Skywalker!The more the show moved forward the more it seemed it didn't focused on boba, it was just a mix of random characters in one place having a mexican standoff.In conclusion, what I would have liked to see is the series focusing itself on the characters and less on the hype, to try and create its own hype slowly instead of having major appearances. More story, less attempts to excite.This show could have been called easily The Sands of Tatooine for example or something in that theme.",1,10,/user/ur98033888/?ref_=tt_urv

Wtf else could I do.?It really took the entire season to form my opinion. Overall , I found plenty to be pleased with and I got to spend time in the universe I love .

tt13668894,ur62460576,7,15 February 2022,"""The Book of Boba Fett"" continues to deepen the huge lore behind the beloved Star Wars franchise. In this case we see what happened to the famous bounty hunter, after he got trapped in the Sarlacc pit back in 1983 when the Return of the Jedi was released. I really appreciated flashbacks, as I finally got to see Boba Fett under a different perspective and overall screenwriters managed to build an interesting backstory for a character that never had much screen time in movies. However, creators did not really know what to do about him, and they focused exclusively on the Mandalorian in the second half of the show. This is not really a complaint, I genuinely believe that the screenwriters did everything in their power to deepen the story of the green armored bounty hunter, but unfortunately there was not enough material to do anything more. Sometimes episodes are really slow, with overwhelming dialogues. Most of the action sequences are captivating and really well done.The cast gave good performances. Temuera Morrison fit the Boba Fett role perfectly. I liked the evolution of Fennec as a character. She finally showed her human side, reveleaning her emotions, by being a bit more vulnerable and honest. Once again Ludwig Goransson composed a wonderful soundtrack. The Boba Fett theme is not as memorable as the Din Djarin one, but it is still an epic and evocative track that is stuck in my head. Practical effects and CGI are nicely done and are faithful to the franchise. The sets and locations are well realized. I personally recommend this Disney+ original.

tt13668894,ur45461313,1,2 January 2022,"I thought Jon faverou's Mandalorian failed on every level to bring autenticity to Star Wars. Just like every Disney project before.Just another director next In line that doesn't get Star Wars at all.. The aesthetics to some degree but not what made Star Wars great.An invisible barrier that blinding them seeing their own work as nothing but short of genius masterpeces and cash cows.The problem Is that theyre just terrible at their work modernising star wars. The shows are nothing more then reprisal of what we seen hundred of times before.Trashy cgi, creatures that doesn't look real or intimidating, terrible cringy humor, uniteresting characters that often are bleak copies of the original trilogy cast. Characters that died in the movies return without any real explanation.We all know Boba Fett died In the sarlacc pitt.Yes for me He died In the Pit. Emperor Died for real In return of the Jedi.What made Fett such badass was the fact that he was a clumpsy, failed cannonfodder bountyhunter with a cool armor. Nothing in the original movies implied otherwise. The fact he died so easy In return of the jedi made Him Iconic.He was just like a cool biker that was unfortunate enough to cross path with Skywalker. Well, that's how I saw Boba Fett from a really young age. Not all great villains needs to be immortal sith lord ninjas.I'm In the camp that truly 100% believes that the fans killed star wars.See my point?! This show just screams milking cash on nerds that somehow still praise every bad movie disney puts out. The more childish, crappy cgi, ridiculus avengers humor the better!Happily this Phenomenon Is only In the states.I haven't met anyone that liked the new star wars In europe. And the all say the same thing to me. Theyre hollow. There's no feeling whatsoever In these movies.The original Star Wars had none of that I mentioned. It was a dark magical fairytale that even had It's share of scary moments. Scary because they where really well made by real artists that worked months on a scene.Every mandalorian episode looks so flimsy and thrown togheter In a whim. (I bet retakes where few and far between) It's B level story design Is just like any other videogame. Go to planet, get help from friends, shoot some dudes, uppgrade armor and ship. The end. There's no depht, no context or thrills to be found. The AT walker Is even bad CGI. It doesn't look frightening anymore. Storm troopers are even dumber than before, they could easily just aim their blasters in the Air. It's just ridiculus. Again! Ridiculus. The monsters do have top quality concept but they are destroyed In complete CGI. And cgi never looks scary. It will always look fake no matter how great the technology. They need to impliment real time animatronic effects In closeups for It to feel like real monsters. Just watch the abomination that was Godzilla vs Kong. It's like watching a long cut scene on playstation 3.It's really that bad! And also Really Sad to see my fav franchise from my youth gets torn asunder.Final verdict: Boba fett Is yet another macho dude walking around In a desert Setting.Fans all over the world! -- yeeeeayy It got desert, (boba fett lives!

tt13668894,ur123203865,6,13 February 2022,"The Book of Boba Fett surpasses the development of character arcs and providing depth to previous canon, in such a way that it removes a lot of the mystery.The silent bounty hunter who never removes his helmet is no more. In this series it seems he's always up for a chat and eager to get fresh air when possible. It's not the character everyone loved, which since his inception was never a normal character, no one wanted this development. You do grow to enjoy the new character though, he's still serious enough to be the epitome of cool, just not the bounty hunter we know and love. It was always going to be a difficult transition moving from the villain to the hero.It is the use of other characters, though, which lets the series down. Tusken Raiders feature heavily early on, and whilst The Mandalorian passes them by to keep them relevant, the addition of Fett being nice to child-Raiders goes too far, becomes too Disney, and a little reminiscent of the infamous Star Wars Christmas special.Fett's youthful and mechanically-enhanced soldiers are hit and miss, but mostly miss. The fact that the ""Mods"" (as in 'modified') ride around on colourful space scooters is a cringeworthy pun forced in and ill-fitting of the setting. They're not going to be anyone's favourite characters, that's for sure, cliché and stuck with unnecessary spins to supplement their action. They had the opportunity to add better characters, the fact that Danny Trejo comes and goes in the matter of two scenes is surely a waste.The fact that halfway through the series Boba Fett is basically dropped from screen-time says a lot. There is reliance on the series it spun off from, The Mandalorian, integrating multiple of the previous characters to keep those arcs moving, before they essentially take centre-stage for the finale. It may also just be setting up Ahsoka Tano's series, but this series wasn't supposed to be about any jedi, full episodes pass without even a reference to Boba Fett.The integration of characters/species formerly only in the cartoons is impressive though, and whilst the pirates look a little more Worzel Gummidge than Star Wars, it's cool to see all the forms of media interlinking. Bringing Cad Bane back into the Western-inspired series works well too, once you've gotten over his face's transition into live action.The stitching of prequel/original trilogies is good, providing a more holistic feel, but he does spend a very long time in that Bacta tank for the first few episodes. Some throwbacks to the original series are hugely appreciated overall though, the Rancor in particular.Morrison has kept in great shape for his age, but he is given no favours by the costuming department. Certainly, and understandably, a little more heavy-set than himself in Attack of the Clones and his predecessor Bulloch in the original trilogy, it's noticeable but passable in The Mandalorian. However, the decision to have the majority of Fett's arc between the films and series with him dressed in a mucky onesie is ridiculous - it emphasises what in fairness is only a slight paunch. Everyone ages, but it loses something when associated with this character.The one thing we wanted to know more from the episodes filling in the gaps was his escape from the Sarlacc pit, but this is skimmed over as quickly as possible - he just gets out. There is no reason given whatsoever other than him having a flamethrower, it's disappointing.Some of the CGI short clips are below par, which again didn't seem to be an issue in The Mandalorian, but from the most part everything looks to be at a high standard (apart from the Mods on the scooters, but again, that's purely down to it being a stupid addition).The series even ends on a Medieval lute song, to cap off a series seriously off the mark. It's far below the standard of The Mandalorian, and although it's great to have Boba Fett back, the potential for this plot is hampered by poor, DIsney-esqe decisions.",8,9,/user/ur123203865/?ref_=tt_urv

Tired of doing others dirty work Boba decide he's gonna take over this place. Only matter don't work out that way when nobody is taken his stake to the Jabba throne serious and what follows is power struggle between the families of this planet for claim. Boba Fett has alway been one of my favorite characters in sci-fi as for so many. While he never did much in the original trilogy he stood out. He was badass looking, quiet, and all around mysterious. Which only added to his popularity that now their just as much lore, and merch for him then any other character in star wars. So the idea of giving he his own show was absolutely a good idea. Especially after seeing him return in the Mandalorian knowing that yeah he's escape the Sarlacc pit and is still alive. So there was a lot of high hopes for this and does live up to the standards that the Mandalorian set? No, but it does have some moments and character's in it some for the better and some for the worst. One of the biggest problem with this show is the pacing and how they chose to go by certain things the shows basically split into to segments for the first 4 episode where half your seeing Bobas flashback want he was doing from his escape of the Sarlacc to him meeting Mando. Pretty much all of this is done well. The internet and people want to play it off like Boba doesn't do anything in this entire shows. That's just not case seeing him interact with the Tuskens showing off more of their custom and ways is great, it adds world building showing him their ways while he teaches them to ride speeder bike that great it's funny. So he does have some moments there just not in the present story of him trying to take over. Once you get into the whole deal with the gangs and the pikes his character arc falls completely apart. He takes a back seat to everybody else around him. The idea of he wants to rule with respect, doesn't want to be another jabba or any of the other Scum. That would be fine if you weren't fighting for territory. You expect the people to pay tribute to you, rival gangs not to attack you. Just because you ask to. He rolls over and has no spine to everybody, and he's soft in these moment where he need to show more of that old side. Really the thing that stops the series from falling apart completely are Fennec and Din Djarin. Fennec is the best Character hands down,really boba doesn't deserve the throne she does, because she's the only one willing to take necessary action. Episode 5&6 they bring Mando back and shows want going on with him and every bit of that is great. It amazing and sets up some much for a another season of the Mandalorian. However I can't give it credit here because this a show about Boba fett. When your bringing in the lead from another of your shows to be the saving grace then that's still not helping. Having Boba act on his own accords and constantly make dumb choices doesn't make you like him. Having unwanted screen time and moments giving to character that nobody cares about and characters that should have more screen time. These mod bikers deserve all the hate they received they don't belong here. Not necessary in star wars but they don't belong here in this dessert setting working for somebody like Boba fett. They look like cyberpunk hipster that you would probary see in the more seedy slum areas of a place like Coruscant. Boba needed more muscle like Black Krrsantan. This Wookie is awesome he need to be in more episodes. The Finale has so much going on so thing cool, but some much Is rushed and to much is going on in it that it takes away screentime for boba, poor use of Cad Bane. Everybody's has plot armor.

tt13668894,ur33659536,5,3 February 2022,"With only one episode left, I feel like I can accurately give my full opinion - if arguably an incomplete one - on ""The Book of Boba Fett."" I'm writing this on February 2, 2022; I just binged episodes 4, 5, and 6. Only episode 7 remains, and while I've never really written a review without seeing the finished product, I believe I have enough information to gauge my overall perceptions on the latest ""Star Wars"" project.Episodes 5 and 6 of ""The Book of Boba Fett"" are very good. Why? Because they aren't actually episodes of ""The Book of Boba Fett."" Episodes 5 and 6 are, for all intents and purposes, basically episodes of season 3 of ""The Mandalorian."" And as a fan of ""The Mandalorian,"" I was exceedingly happy to see Mando back in action as the bounty hunter we all know and love. With two seasons of ""The Mandalorian"" already aired, us as viewers have already built up a liking to the titular character and his plight. Pedro Pascal is exceptional as Mando - he's bold, cold, and badass when he needs to be, as well as genuinely caring and empathetic when he wants. It was a total pleasure to see Mando once again, and it also helped that the direction of episodes 5 and 6 were about one million times better than episodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. And how were episodes 1 - 4? The short answer is: not too good.The longer answer is: Episodes 1 - 4 are extremely bland and, unfortunately, forgettable. When the character of Boba Fett was first introduced in ""The Mandalorian,"" I was ecstatic based on how badass his entrance is. As ruthless and lethal as you'd expect a master bounty hunter to be, Boba Fett exterminated his enemies with brutal precision every time he appeared on screen in ""The Mandalorian."" So, as you may expect, I assumed that he would employ the same tactics in ""The Book of Boba Fett."" Not so! Instead of being the bounty hunter we expected, in this show, Boba is the crime lord that no one wanted. While I understand the character arc the show runners and writers are going for, the reason anyone is watching a show with Boba Fett is because they want to watch him hunt people down and kill them. While there are a few action scenes few and far between during the first four episodes, you'll mostly be privy to Boba engaging in long, boring conversations with other people. And if you watch your television with subtitles, you'll find that ""The Book of Boba Fett"" is an apt title, as you'll be reading as much as you would be if you were reading an actual novel.Lack of bounty hunting action aside, ""The Book of Boba Fett"" just isn't that interesting. With a disjointed, disorganized story that jumps back and forth between past and present, it's hard to be emotionally engaged in either plot line. At one point Boba is working with Tusken Raiders, and before you know it the story will jump to the present where he is inexplicably a crime lord, albeit a seemingly unsuccessful one. And while this show obviously wants to reveal its secrets with each concurrent episode, instead of finding myself intrigued and wanting to learn more, I was confused and frustrated at the lack of context. Was it really the best idea to start the show with Boba being a crime lord without any explanation as to how, or why he got there? While the intention was to add mystery, the decision ultimately led to disorientation.With all that said, there's no denying that episodes 1 - 4 are not good. With a boring, incomprehensible plot line, uncharacteristic characters, and a lack of good action - and not to mention the cringy cyberpunk street gang - the first four episodes are about as difficult to sit through as ""A Serbian Film."" However, episodes 5 and 6 almost make the wait worth it, as the return of Mando added much needed rejuvenation. At the time of this writing there is only one episode left of ""The Book of Boba Fett"" - I imagine I will enjoy it strictly because Mando is back. And the fact that it took the return of The Mandalorian for me to truly start enjoying this show is really all you need to know about the overall quality of Boba Fett's series. I will certainly watch the final episode, and maybe it will be so remarkable as to completely change my opinion on this series, but as of right now I find my feelings solidified, and my feelings are that ""The Book of Boba Fett"" is a mediocre series, enhanced by the fact that episodes five and six may as well be from a different (better) series altogether.",26,46,/user/ur33659536/?ref_=tt_urv

And only now has Disney finally satisfied their desires.General impressions: of course, he can't compete with the ""Mandalorian"". But at the same time, the series leaves a very pleasant feeling after watching it.The plot is quite simple. Boba decides to give up the life of a mercenary and become the boss of Tatooine, which is persistently called the backyard of the universe, but 80% of the most important events take place there. We are also shown flashbacks of how Boba survived in the Sarlock pit. At the same time, a simple narrative and local history are skillfully diluted by the appearance of familiar, and sometimes cult characters, which does not let the viewer get bored. But there were some disadvantages: there are several fillers that are quite boring and do not carry any load.The authors of the series again immerse us in the boundless sands of Tatooine, which look familiar, but at the same time we learn something new about this planet every time. Also, another very beautiful location appears in the series (I will not spoiler).There is action in the series, there is not much of it, but it is made of high quality, a special shootout in the style of the Wild West.Another component is the soundtrack. Ludwig Joransson managed to create an ideal musical composition corresponding to the spirit of the series.Temuera Morrison finally got enough screen time, but I can't say that his acting work impressed me. The rest of the actors also did a good job, but again, no one showed emotions like in the last episode of season 2 of ""Mandalorian"".In general, I can say that this is a good series for everyone who loves ""Star Wars"" to watch. And even more so, it's much better than the disgusting new trilogy.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur106184494/?ref_=tt_urv
tt13668894,ur6025018,5,23 January 2022,"Anyone who remembers Boba Fett from the films recalls the reputation of the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy. A bounty hunter who had Wookie pelts on his belt. A bounty hunter who would do whatever it took to get the job done. He was nobody's friend. Even Han Solo's priceless reaction in ROTJ at the Sarlacc pit of, ""Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?!"" tells you the kind of character he was.Now, Boba Fett takes over as crime lord from Bib Fortuna. Only now, Fett is trying to do right by everyone. He's got a small entourage of allies. He makes friends with the Sand People, and he's somehow gone from ruthless bounty hunter to a peacekeeping wuss. Imagine if Darth Maul came back suddenly cuddling teddy bears.It was as if the writers no longer had a handle on the character. Mandalorian is more bad-ass than Fett and far more believable as a character.I tried to get into this series as I was really excited for it. But after three episodes, I couldn't take it anymore. The most feared (and arguably) beloved bounty hunter got melted down into a baby-powdered chump who is about as feared as an Ewok.Disney definitely did wrong by this series.",64,94,/user/ur6025018/?ref_=tt_urv
tt13668894,ur19932818,4,21 January 2022,"Discussions around The Book of Boba Fett, the latest ""Star Wars thing"", are nothing if not educational. Among other things, we can learn about what is and is not ""character development"", as understood by fans of the show:Character development is when someone falls into a man-eating rectum in the desert and almost everything he does after he survives runs counter to what we once knew of him -- however little there was to actually adapt/follow up on -- without much of an arc or journey to get us from points A to Z. Remember vicious assassin-for-hire Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison)? Apparently he's really a way-too-trusting charmer who loves animals and is an ally to the indigenous tribes of Tatooine. Was he always this friendly and we just weren't shown? As of this writing, the show has yet to clarify.But this brings us to the second thing we've learned from defenders of this series, namely what ""positive indigenous representation"" is. Positive indigenous representation is when the Tusken Raiders, shown in every appearance they've had (including this supposedly pro-Tusken show) to torture and enslave anyone who disturbs them (sometimes not even that, as with Mommy Skywalker), are used for pro-indigenous commentary. I understand being moved by the sentiment, especially as the man who ultimately delivers it is a Maori actor, but something about the decision to use the Sand People seems really tone-deaf.You might argue it's a deconstruction of older Star Wars and its tacit attitudes (after all, a lot of new additions to geek media like to dabble in self-satire, metacommentary, and other stuff that tends to fall flat and ruin what was once useful escapism, especially to irritable neckbeards) but it plays more like Star Wars having a poor memory of itself. And even if some might also argue that the choice of Sand People is apt, as several indigenous peoples (no matter how saintly they look in modern depictions) have indeed dabbled in slave trade and torture, isn't modern woke Disney meant to keep people from realizing that?I get it. Film and TV are almost always fantastical to some extent -- especially sci-Fantasy Westerns, turns out. Natives in real life don't lay ancestral claim to entire planets and they don't ride around on space yaks or snort magical drug-lizards, so it may be foolish to take the depiction of the Sand People (and their acts) too literally. However, death and violence are clearly supposed to mean something in the (literal) universe of Star Wars; to constitute something that feels ""real"" amidst the space wizards, looming Star Destroyers, and Joh Yowza.On some level, these works discernably want us to care about canon; about what actually occurs in-universe -- and said events can absolutely harm the themes. I used the infamous Rose Tico example in a recent Twitter discussion; this very scene, taken at face value, kills its own intended message of ""We need to save what we love rather than destroy what we hate"" by having Rose prevent Finn the Stormtrooper from destroying a First-Order laser cannon, lest he die himself (ergo she does admittedly save someone she loves), and then, as if it were a punchline, shows the cannon blasting the sh-t out of the base that Finn may have otherwise saved.À la the WandaVision discourse, I was told not to take this scene too literally, like the film wasn't really expecting me to be invested in the events and character actions of its own climax, but let's say we ARE expected to take it literally: Tell me honestly, would the scene not have worked much better for the message if Rose Tico didn't do the opposite of saving her friends from a gargantuan siege weapon? These aren't Ruttman-esque abstractions. Things still HAPPEN in this pretend reality; there are PERSONS in the text that we're meant to like, yet the rest of the text won't let us.And alas, what happens in this show rarely makes sense either and its characters are dull when they aren't being stupid -- in ways that can't always be explained away by some grand ""point"", I might add. Fans have complained that some additions, like those 1950s-looking space bikers, seem more like something out of Jem and the Holograms or Power Rangers, but I would argue they fit in quite well if you view the Star Wars Holiday Special as canon. The Book of Boba Fett certainly seems to do so, judging by some of the better, subtler lines.On the subject of things to praise about the show, I do want to commend Morrison's leading performance (winning over those who may have doubted him in Attack of the Clones and the Empire re-dub), even as I can't always make sense of Boba's decisions -- whether I acknowledge his previous appearances or not (and if none of the other films are meant to be canon, why even sell this show as ""more Boba Fett""?). He's either a one-man-army or a bit old and clunky, depending on what the plot needs, but yes, Morrison's an absolute treasure.Best of all, in my opinion, is the score! We all loved the Western feel of The Mandalorian, but returning composer Ludwig Göransson, a fellow Swede, now pays homage to one of his homeland's literary icons by adding a Ronja Rövardotter-type chant (referencing a lullaby from the 1984 Tage Danielsson film as adapted from Astrid Lindgren).And yes, in terms of recreating the sets, costumes, and general appearance of OG Star Wars, this one is at least as accurate as The Mandalorian. It might even be a little TOO accurate. Consider the Greedo-looking dude who's clearly not a real alien but looks like a guy in a costume from a 1970s sci-fi film.Despite my complaints, I am interested in seeing where this is going, even as it exemplifies many of the annoying trends in modern nostalgia-bait conent. 'Member berries, ""No-one's ever really gone"", and also ""No-one's ever truly evil"". Remember how Cruella deVil and Maleficient, two of the most gloriously vile Disney villains in the Animated Canon, were just oppressed and misunderstood this whole time? Apparently that also goes for man-eating Rancor and murderous bounty hunters.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv

tt13668894,ur45507551,6,9 February 2022,"The show is a mixed bag. That is If you count 2 good episodes out of 7 a mixed bag.Let me say at first that to this day, I still don't get the hype about Boba Fett. Is the mask, is it the jetpack or what? I get Mando, because we actually see him be a total badass for two season. But Boba? We only saw him for like 5 minutes in the original trilogy. So I'm not much of a Boba Fett fan and don't understand why this series needed to exist and after watching it, I still think it was unnecessary and did more bad than good.Now firstly I'm gonna say what's good about it then I'll give a mini-rant about the bads because I ranted a lot in the episode reviews.The good:Ludwig Göransson does it again with another iconic piece of music.Episode 5 and 6. Which are not about Boba and they're about Mandalorian, a better and more badass bounty hunter. And that's cheating too because they put Mandalorian season 3 episodes in here so people keep watching this show.And that's it! That's the only good thing about this series.Now the bad:The power ranger gang.Boba is not a badass. He slept with Tuskens two nights and now he's a benevolent ruler and wants to rule the city with his soft heart I guess.Boba has no strategy in the whole 7 episodes. He just agrees with what others say and can't assert dominance on any one, he's a laughing stock for all the other rulers and commanders in this series.Boba is a complete idiot and does some significantly idiotic Baffling things, prominently in episode 4. For example; Boba: ""Look at me, I am Boba Fett."" Boba 5 minutes later: ""There's an advantage to people thinking you're dead.""The power ranger gang.The show, apart from episode 5 and 6, doesn't feel like Star Wars at all. It feels likes I'm watching a weird Sci-Fi that ripped off these characters and names from Star Wars and not actually watching Star Wars. You can see the clear contrast of it when you watch episode 5 after the fairly excruciating first 4 episodes. It doesn't feel, look and sound like Star Wars.They tried to make a badass character off of Boba and they succeeded beautifully with Mandalorian, but realized they effed up and now that they're making a Boba Fett show, they have to make him different, and thus less badass and that's the reason they ruined Boba Fett.The power ranger gang.Fennec Shand is more of a badass than Boba.The Pykes are hyped to be this evil and powerful syndicate that have an army to destroy everyone and take over the city, but they're laughably weak and shorter in numbers than they claimed to be in the finale.Cad Bane was wasted and should've been the main adversary from the beginning.Boba needs men and more soldiers but in no way he attempts to hire even one person before the big finale.Episode 3.Flashbacks should've been shorter and they should've made episode 2 and 1 into 1 first episode and got rid of episode 3 and the power ranger gang entirely.The direction and writing of episodes 1,2,3,4 and 7 are abysmal.Episode 5 and 6 being actually good and everyone enjoying them shows that even the creators know that nobody wanted this and they didn't even know what to write and do about Boba Fett.Lots and lots of plot holes about Boba being the Daimyo.There were a of lot better stories to tell, like how Boba actually became the Daimyo, instead of showing us flashbacks and the disappointing Pykes as the main villain.I hope they learn their lesson and don't just make a new show about every character if they don't have a pretty good idea about it, especially if it's and old and known and fan-favorite character.And I think even giving it a 6 is too generous considering I only enjoyed the last 3 episodes.And like I said in the title, only watch it for episode 5 and 6 to get ready for season 3 of much much better show.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur45507551/?ref_=tt_urv

The expectations it had to live up to we're almost impossible, ""The Mandalorian"" was just too good, but this was still a good show. I will admit, after the first 4 episodes, I was debating giving this show a 8 or 9/10, but the 5th and 6th episodes definitely made the season a 10/10. The finale was also amazing as well, I thought its rating would be higher.The one thing I really liked about this show was how for the first four episodes, it was the ""Book"" of Boba Fett. We got the entire story of what happened with him from when he was eaten by the Sarlacc pit in ""Return of the Jedi"" to when we saw him again in ""The Mandalorian."" Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni did a great job in those first four episodes balancing his backstory with a plot from the present. Then when his story was told, the entire season switched gears to being fully focused on the present time. That is when we were blown away with the 5th and 6th episodes, and an amazing finale. Once again phenomenal writing by Favreau and Filoni.The characters in this show were also pretty cool. We got some new faces to the Star Wars universe in the first few episodes, but my favorite character 100% has to be Black Krrsantan. Don't get me wrong, Chubacca will always be my favorite Wookiee, but Black Krrsantan was sick. We also got the return of Max Rebo! I love that guy. The 5th and 6th episodes were also loaded with huge appearances of characters we have seen before, but I won't spoil it.Finally, the action was very good. Ok, besides the Mos Espa chase scene in episode 3. Some of my favorite action scenes were the ones when Boba was trining with the Sand People. I just thought those were choreographed so well. But the finale was the episode that had the best action with episode 5 being close behind it. The only reason I liked the finale better was because almost the entire episode was an action scene, and they were all great.This show should have gotten more love than it did in my opinion, but it was still really good. I don't know if there is any news on it yet but I really hope there is a season 2. I would like to see a different story of Boba not on Tatooine. I think that would be cool to see.

I didn't really care about this show until episode 5, where the Mandalorian came in and we basically got a Mandalorian episode. This episode was amazing, but really presents a problem with this show. When the best episode of your show doesn't even have your main character or have anything to do with the main premise of the show, it kind of shows how Boba Fett and his mission weren't executed correctly.

But we were baited into thinking we were getting a gritty crime drama, with ruthless Boba as shown in the Mandalorian but it did a complete 180. You can be mature and not be push over towards everyone around you. There were power inconsistencies: Boba taking down a sand monster after he escaped the Sarlacc (when he's supposedly weaker), but getting his behind kicked in the present day against the no-name assassins (""night wind""), even doing something as stupid as shooting a shield at point-blank (makes no sense he is an expert warrior at this point he knows better). Straight contradictions: Boba who knows his ship can be remote activated and come to his location by the touch of his wrist in Ep 7 decides to summon the Rancour and destroys the city while ""saving"" the city to stop the scorpion droids. And general oddities The ""mods"" were too colorful and jarring characters for a place like Tatooine, this would work on Coruscant but here it felt cheesy. The soundtrack is great, and it looked clean for the most part but many including myself were underwhelmed.",6,9,/user/ur118665987/?ref_=tt_urv

Certainly the introduction of Cad Bane is hilariously silly. But also the end of E7 is ridiculous. Yes I know they try to reference to old movies, but come-on. Has star wars become comedy? Yes maybe. A hero, with no armour, gets shots several times without dying. But when he gets shot in the foot he starts limping and requires rescuing. Only to run away without a problem in the text shot.

tt13668894,ur88913493,1,10 February 2022,"So, let me get this straight - Bloated Fett is going to war (in the final episode) and it's against some secret herbs & spices KFC tribe opposition? (Some build-up, some basis.) Who's Blubber Foot here to claim that the secret herbs & spices are killing ""his"" people when it looks like he's the one who's been eating a bucket of fried chicken every day? Can you hear yourself, dude? And since when was mercenary Boba Fett a leader? He's a self-indulged ruthless people trader. And why is he cowering from these fish soldiers at the end battle? Isn't he supposed to be the most feared bounty hunter in the entire galaxy? (He looks like Kojak.) These fish baddies in the ""Ghost"" masks look like Twiggy from Buck Rogers. Weren't these same fish warriors in that other movie Dead Sushi? Here we go again - Mando & Blubber Feet are outnumbered 50-to-2 yet they can take down all these Dead Sushi warriors with petulant ease while sustaining no damage in return. Elsewhere, some emo kids are riding what looks like retro 50's kitchen appliances. Adds nothing to the story line. Even Harry and the Henderson's gets shot by ground beam thingys and nothing fatally damages him. He must be wearing armored fur? A couple of Terminator Sand Crabs show up, and like Stormtroopers, they're a lousy aim and hit nothing! Since when was The Rancor Monster a good guy? Or Sandpeople for that matter? (Sandpeople in A New Hope jumped Luke Skywalker and looted his ride. So now they're good guys we're supposed to care for?) So, this is The Rancor Monster's King Kong moment up the building? Lucas Film has no shame. Nothing's safe. Who was this ""Pale Rider"" Smurf character with the bloodshot eyes and vacuum tubes walking around with the Lee Marvin voice? It didn't even have a name. (If you're filming a western, why didn't you just re-imagine Bonanza and leave Star Wars damn well alone? That whole town gun slinging business isn't science fiction.) I love this part when the lady from Cheers goes flying through the air, face first, at speed. Talk about ""ladies first."" The Mandalorian does everything in his power to save the curtain climber green grogan character but lets her break her neck.So, all this enemy fire and not one good guy is hit & killed yet the baddies drop like flies in return? Wow, the green grogan character can fly an X-wing now, huh? It's a wonder it didn't pull out a light blazer and slash fools down like Yoda did against Dracula at the end of that Power of the Clones tripe. Being outnumbered, and outmanned, Mando & Blubber Foot win in the end as usual and as an afterthought, as Fenech didn't appear in the final battle, they just have her kill the mayor Hammerhead and his cronies then finish it off with a further outtake where Mando and the green grogan character do a comedy sketch.In all this Book of Baloney Scrapple you've produced, Disney, there's one tiny aspect you've neglected - an iconic John Williams opera theme score. (John Carpenter turned Halloween into some movie distributors without the score and they said NO DICE, MAN.)
And speaking of iconic, congratulations Disney, you've managed to ruin another iconic character from the past. You had one chance at the Boba Fett story line and you blew it. You have destroyed the legacy of a mean, lean and mystical figure and turned him into a crippled geriatric with no direction or purpose. As I recall he went into the Sarlacc Pit a fit young man yet came out an old overweight slob. And I don't recall any Stormtroopers on the Sail Barge in Return of the Jedi so how could they reside dead in the belly of the beast?Disney can't do nothing right. Allowing Disney the rights to Star Wars was like putting a gun in the hands of the wrong person - it was misused. I resent them taking over the Star Wars franchise to this day.Overall, The Book of Blubber Feet (what book?) is about some overweight retired New Zealand rugby player who literally has wet dreams while hooked up to a 2-1B torture chamber device, (It can induce tormenting wet dreams and other torture methods.) The first 2 episodes I sat there like a turd floating in water, dumbfounded at how cheap and directionless Disney is, as it just churned out stagnated Mandalorian leftovers. After the third episode I sat there like a stunned fish beaten senseless of all nerve endings. Episode 3 will leave you with no jaw bone as it'll fall off in disbelief after you see the ending. (Vroom vroom.) Episode one has some Goro character at the end - whoop-de-doo. It was probably a design reject from that woeful 2021 Mortal Kombat crap?Lucas Film is lost without its main villains in Vader and The Emperor. Now the main villain is just a squabbling mayor who trades in secret herbs & spices and under the table cash advances, (A furry coat wearing wealthy Hammerhead of all things.) This show's so redundant and pathetic they've even rehashed that ""Solo"" story line AGAIN about the train heist. Like we didn't get it the first time? The worst episode by far is episode 3 with all those emo kids on colored love bikes which consisted of Joan Jett; Harry Potter in his Hogwarts blazer and Michael Winslow who wears some sort of compass beacon on his eye? I could not believe what I was watching in that episode at the end with the street chase on the 50's kitchen appliances. (Rose Taco became my favorite Star Wars character after seeing part 8 but now I'm leaning toward Joan Jett in episode 3 of Book of Blubber Foot. WHAT AN ACTRESS.) This show is that misguided that in later episodes it turned back into The Mandalorian as direction is so lousy at Lucas Film. I only watched this crap in hope that Bespin Cloud City would appear in a flashback - it didn't. Ain't that a bite? The Karate Kid was quoted as saying that West Valley High sucks, man, it sucks. The Book of Blubber Foot sucks, man, it sucks. Give it up, Disney. And this is coming from a kid who was there in '77 brought up on Kenner toys, A New Hope and ESB. I was there from day one. We nurtured this franchise, the fans, and made it into what it became and you've destroyed it for us, Disney. It's like you've done it intentionally. So much for Kathleen Kennedy's pledge to protect the integrity of Lucas' original movies. I can't even watch the original Star Wars classics anymore this day & age thanks to your takeover.

Forget that a good side character does not necessarily make a good main character-in fact they almost never do and that is why spin-offs are generally so underwhelming.Boba Fett is not a main character. He isn't even really a character, per se; he is a cool-looking costume, which is all he needed to be to gain the admiration of fans. I felt a disconnect watching this when 'Boba Fett' spent an inordinate amount of time as an old, bald dude in a cape. Without his armor he isn't even recognizable as the same character, so the question remains of why we're supposed to care...But beside this conceptual bother, the show is just badly made. This Boba Fett seems determined to act in the most uncool manner imaginable, whether apologizing for micro-aggressions or chasing a tiny droid around a kitchen.The soundtrack blares techno beats, and any resemblance to Star Wars slowly vanishes.

These guys could have worked on say Corascant, that artificial shiny technological corporate planet of the Star Wars universe. You know that place where it all goes terribly wrong in Ep3!!I could make an Analogy here but I think you get tye driftNothing looks like it belongs in tatooine here, it all looks like Dubai but in the glossy pictures and videos, the reality is different, even in the fake artificial city of Dubai, its still in a desert and things still get dusty and dirty very quickly.This does'nt seem to be the case on neo Tattoine.So the asthethic is all wrong but the story is like a series of drawn out comic book vignettes. In this situation its so important to get the look spot on. Like 300, Sin City, Matrix, Mad Max e.t.cLook at Star Wars, New Hope. ( You know, the actual source material ) or how about look at The Mandolorian !!But No !! This is a poor committee drawn up attempt to get kids into Star Wars by making everything Bright, Clean and Sparkly with the colour pallette only an 8 yr old would enjoy.3/10 nowHmmm where to begin..Ill start with I really liked Mandalorian I thought it was well made and produced, it had a great story and character building and looked spot on.As for The book of Boba Fett...Well Boba Fett has aged more than anyone else in the star wars universe, he also got hefty cumbersome and slow.Now according to lore in Ep2 Boba Fett would age at the same rate as his father and not like the clones.He seemed to recieve some scarring from the Sarlecs digestive acids but he was wearing Mandalorian armour and helmet. Im not sure how long he was down there but he needed extra oxygen from the stormtrooper so it could not have been that long. Maybe it leaked through a hole ?However the scarring is healed through the use of a bacta tank presumably post Mandalorian appearance as he had scarring in that.Of course the main reason for his ageing is the actors ageing in real life, it seems they lacked the ability to utilise this into the show that made sense but I guess we are only at ep1.The episode lasted just over 30 minutes so not much time to fit a lot in.Now to the bad stuffThe costumes looked awful, ive seen better Cosplay.The aliens looked awful, what happened to the Gamorreans they looked like normal guys in a bad fat suit. You could see the human eyes popping through the poor head mask, they looked more realistic 38 years ago !! The same can be said for the Twi'leks, bright luminous rubbery skin and horns ( are they horns or ears )The fight scene looked awful, slow cumbersome and amateurish.The CGI monster looked rubbery and cartoony.The meandering soundtrack was background noise and had a kind of generic tribal sound.The acting was goddam awful, Temuera mumbles his lines in a gruff tone throughout. Ming-Na as Fennec was ok, the supporting cast however delivered there lines like a stage show parody while looking like a cosplay parody.Now for the story so far he escapes the belly of the Sarlec but is captured, his past is told in series of dreams he is having while in the Bacto tub.In the present he has taken over from Bib Fortuna who took over from Jabba but it looks like on day 1 he is under threat.We know the story already of how he got his armour back after watching Mandolorian now we find out how he lost it, damn Jawas.Thats about as much as we get from EP1.I'll try and continue with this as Bobba Fett is cool or he was.Im not sure if I can handle more amateur hour though ( sorry half hr )5/10 so far.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur17402378/?ref_=tt_urv

Two stars for that dumpster fire.The last three episodes are a hybrid Mandalorian continuation from that series' season two. Eight stars for that, losing some points because the last episode is very poorly choreographed and written. And Robert Rodriguez was the director, so he knows better.There are things IN this series that are fun, but it's not ABOUT anything. Ming-Na Wen is good (as usual), but the actor portraying Boba (and re-inhabiting the role he's best known for) does an inadequate job of infusing any gravitas in the lead character. One of the greatest bounty hunters in the galaxy? But managing to get his butt kicked by adolescent sand people and a scaly oversized pet? That just doesn't make sense. The frequent trips to the bacta tank serve only to insert more exposition.Things happen to Boba, all he does is react. When he's in really dire straits others intervene to save his hide, whether it's Fennec Shand, or the evil Wookie. That steals his agency and makes his story very dependent on others. What he doesn't do is drive the story, basically because there isn't much of a story. The lengthy scene with young rebellious bikers chasing down a slimy politician is really just useless filler, and an example of the long side stories that clutter this series. There is no compelling reason to chase him down (or really for his character at all), they just do.It isn't any surprise that the best (and apparently most popular) episodes are the ones that follow the Mandalorian. It says a lot that Pedro Pascal can generate so much energy and charisma when his face is (almost) always covered. It's also revealing that the series' best episode didn't show one clip of the lead character, and the one following that one only shows Boba in one unnecessary scene. The last episode is pretty dumb, right up to the staged a and unnecessary duel.It's fun learning new details of beloved characters and cultures, and diehard fans will get excited about the old histories being unraveled and the colorful bit characters, but the sluggish, uninteresting non-plot will never be remembered as a great Star Wars adventure.And it's hard to score this series on its own merits when it actually feels like two separate series.",9,13,/user/ur67921566/?ref_=tt_urv

tt13668894,ur23522801,3,11 February 2022,"Disney takes a minor, albeit intriguing character from the original Star Wars trilogy and tries to make us all care about him because, well, its Star Wars.Fett was a bounty hunter who never spoke a word and was last seen in Return of the Jedi being dropped into and presumably eaten by some toothy pit on Tatooine. We see him again in The Mandalorian as, apparently, a clone wearing his father's Mandalorian-type armor. I think that should have been enough.Now he's back, and takes over Jabba the Hutt's criminal empire on Tatooine. Why? Well, just because he's tired of ""idiots telling him what to do"" as a bounty hunter. The gaps between the toothy pit are filled in with flashbacks, as he's captured by then adopted by the Tusken Raiders, aka Sand People. The old western trope of being taken in by the Indians. Eventually (spoiler) they're wiped out by, essentially, a biker gang that Fett then wipes out himself once he regains his ship - which is one of the most ridiculous craft ever designed. Might work in space, not in atmosphere. He's assembling a crew of reformed criminals starting with his Mary Sue assassin sidekick from Mandalorian (she never misses any shot, and takes down multiple experienced fighters twice her size every time without a scratch - all in her late 50s), a rogue Wookie, two pigmen, and a youth gang of part-droid humans who ride Vespas.Most of the series he appears to say, ""I am Boba Fett."" Expecting everyone to immediately know/fear/respect him. Or else he kills them.As with Mandalorian (who shows up to boost the series, and show how it pales in comparison even though picks up a one-seat speeder - for bounty hunting?), the production design, costumes, and special effects are superb. The acting remains wooden and the plot is thin as Boba's coif. No one really cares about a minor character taking over a crime empire. It's almost like the plot is there just to show the great production values. It has way too many mindless fights where the good guys don't get a scratch and every bad guy dies.

While being a good continuation of Boba Fett, it does feel a bit unnecessary. The story is good, while the acting is just alright, even a bit dull at times. It starts out with telling the story through flashbacks and the present, which works greatly in its favor, and in these episodes it feels like the story of Boba Fett. It quickly changes pace though and introduce familiar characters and faces, some used as cameos and others to move the story forward, which was amazing, but the focus is taken away from the actual main character.At times it does feel a bit slow and meaningless, but the ending is worth the entire setup and story and is a great finale ultimately redeeming the character to some extend. It does have a hard time balancing Bobas story and setting up and entirely different series, and tries to be ""the new Mandalorian"" but not succeeding.

I did manage to warm up to him, but the show as a whole doesn't convince.Roughly the first four episodes tell us, in the form of flashbacks, the story of what happened to Boba Fett after he ended up in the Sarlacc pit.So, he didn't die, he got ""saved"" by sand people and I reckon we're supposed to develop some kind of emotional connection with them. While I don't think this story was necessarily bad in itself, it really is very shallow and for what it is, way too slow. The language barrier (if you can call those donkey sounds a language) doesn't make connecting with them any easier. And then they're all dead, and that was that. Ok then.. This just felt like a huge waste of time and we have learned pretty much nothing about Boba in the process.I didn't enjoy the flashbacks as a mechanism. They're used mostly to mask the fact that we're served hardly an episode worth of meaningful backstory content. At the same time it also cuts into the content that plays out in the ""present"", which in itself isn't that great either. The unfortunate end-result is a very shallow, unhinged jumble which barely manages to hold itself upright in the small area between bad and just passable.The episode with the power ranger kids gang merits special mention in the sense that it was hilariously poor and stupid in almost every regard.Then we get The Mandalorian S03E01+E02.While I did enjoy these episodes for what they are (and let's be honest, what they are is fan service with a boatload of nostalgia more than anything else), the fact that they're included so profoundly in a show about Boba Fett is just silly. These two episodes are also better than the previous four, which makes this choice even more jarring. And by ""better"" I mean good; because they're definitely not masterpieces.Truth be told, I'd rather have seen 4 full episodes worth of meaningful content of Boba and his endeavors. Leave The Mandalorian season 3 episodes for the actual The Mandalorian season 3.The ending was a letdown with really nothing at stake, more fan service and bad CGI. It's crystal clear that all the episodes directed by Robert Rodriguez are, by far, the worst of the bunch. He is obviously not a Star Wars director, please keep him out of it in the future. Unfortunately, he directed 3 out of 7 episodes and with the two Mandalorian episodes in between, we're left with only 2 out of 7 Boba Fett episodes that are passable at best, in a show about Boba Fett.

The Finale seemed rushed and cheesy. There were just so many characters in this series I didn't care about and never did and others I did like and ended up either not liking or was disappointed with the way they were written. Fennec shines in this show and is basically exactly how everyone expected Boba to be. So taking into effect a lot of bad acting, a lot of poorly written material and a lackluster finale then on the flip side having the two really good Mando episodes and the screen time Fennec got, this is a mixed bag. I would say overall average at best.

Boba Fett's storyline is intriguing but not as intresting as Mando's storyline, but the two mesh well together. There are things that were screwed up to me. Cad Bane is a lot stronger than that and his death was anti climatic. The new character's are dull. And Boba Fett has gone softer for some reason but it doesn't make sense character-wise. He was a tough mercenary, a remnant of Clones and Mandalorian. He said the Sand People treated him like family but they didn't at first they treated him like a slave. And him losing that family drove him to work for the good of the people of tattooine. But it doesn't feel too fleshed out. Also he takes his helmet off way too much, talks too much, and his character should be smarter, and tougher. Boba constantly gets knocked down by the easiest of threats. But he prevails. His character is fun to see but it doesn't feel like the same Boba Fett from the films and clone wars TV show. Also he just hires some teenagers to fight off the syndicate, and I don't know where they learned to fight either. They just kicked ass for no reason. They just wanted regular jobs originally.On more positive notes, seeing Luke and Ahsoka again was amazing. The music was good. Battle scenes were really well choreographed and fun. Amazing effects, practical and cgi included, that's to be expected in Star wars though. Loved the Mandalorian episodes and really loved the naboo ship, and when it through where the Pod race course Anakin went on in Phantom Menace. It had an enjoyable finale that felt conclusive.The show has heart and promise, but lacks motivation and drive. Especially from Boba Fett. I want him to be further developed and hopefully the show can present what happened in his childhood as a young bounty hunter. Would gladly watch a season 2 but they have to be careful from here.

He had a cool outfit, followed his own agenda, was quiet and reserved, but quite menacing with even Vader reminding him not to kill his target.Before that, he had a little known debut in the dreaded Star Wars Holiday Special.Boba Fett was one of the many characters who were more interesting than their role in the story required, which was part of what made Star Wars so interesting. It was a lived in universe which was fun to explore, while leaving enough mystery to keep your imagination going.Enter Disney, and that all that imagination stuff goes right out the window. Now everything is explained in detail, the audience is spoon fed constant exposition and world building, all of it less interesting than not understanding how that universe works and exploring it with likeable main characters.The Book of Boba Fett plays much like the Mandalorian. We have a tough main character in Mandalorian armor, an honorable warrior who keeps his promises, but has his own agenda and tries to make his way in the seedier parts of the galaxy.Clint Eastwood's man with no name in space.So far so generic. As with the Mandalorian, the series suffers from its tiny budget, with scenes taking place on tiny soundstages with digital backgrounds added later on. It feels extremely cheap, and a badly scaled down version of the usual grandeur of Star Wars.There are lots of hand to hand fight scenes with very accommodating stunt men, cgi monsters and the usual earning the respect of the savage locals by being tough and beating up dangerous foes. Yawn. Seen it all before. The writing is atrocious and doesn't feel at all like Star Wars. The music is even worse, with generic action themes like you'd expect on a stock music library. B-budget video games have better music than this.The cgi itself is quite good, which is probably the main reason to watch this. I can't think of many others.Even Temura Morrison seems disinterested and feels like a tired old man most of the time. A far cry from how Boba was portrayed in the movies: Alert, observant, ready to strike at any given moment.But Disney had to go the charmless, world weary antihero route again. That's something that's not overdone at all...My advice: skip to the action scenes if you need your Star Wars fight scene fix, and skip the rest. Or skip all of it.

He misses the oppotunity to parallel / integrate the initiation of Boba Fett with a much later digression into an initiation of a different character.Instead of further developing the early storylines into the proper 8-10 episode arch with a proper middle and payoff ending, they are dropped, and the series becomes a simplistic good guys versus bad guys shoot-em-up -- which left little to the imagination, and completely lost all wonderment of ""what comes next.""

tt13668894,ur69986981,4,9 February 2022,"Who asked for this show? Actually... a lot of people. In retrospect it would have been better if we hadn't gotten it at all since they completely destroyed the identity of the beloved Boba Fett character making him soft, weak, incompetent and just damn stupid! What started off as an interesting character in The Mandalorian quickly became a joke when he got his own show. You would think that that's when the character would blossom right? Oh, how wrong you are!The Book of Boba Fett is a series whose tone has just felt so off and dysfunctional! The first 4 episodes are completely different to episodes 5 and 6 and by the time you make it to the final, 7th episode, you wonder which type of episode are you gonna get? Will it be more like the last two episodes (which would be a good thing) or will it be more like the first 4 (which would be a terrible thing)? What they then decided to do, since these versions of the show are tonally so off, they desperately tried to forcefully merge those two versions together and ta-da... Episode 7! Yikes!It is also beyond me why we focused 4 entire episodes on our main character's backstory (but not even his proper backstory from when he was a child which would have been way more interesting). Why? We've already seen him in The Mandalorian and most of it was self-explanatory. It's like the creators think of us as dummies and ask themselves
""Oh, surely they wouldn't figure that out on their own right? Clearly our audience is the most stupid and simple-minded one out there, so we have to explain every little detail even if it isn't interesting or completely detrimental to the pacing of our show"".It is amazing how barely any time was spent on Boba Fett's present storyline. You could just tell that they didn't really have a story to tell. On top of that, they made our protagonist soft. I don't view Boba Fett as any kind of threat anymore. If I was in the Star Wars universe and Boba Fett walked up to me alone (and of course with his mask off because apparently that's just what he does now), I would laugh my ass off, probably throwing a cherry at his bald head and I can guarantee you, he would ask me whether I wanted to join his team.The saddest thing about this show however was that I was genuinely happy whenever the show didn't focus on Boba Fett, but instead on someone else because that's when it actually triumphed, however that's the problem.You have a main character who constantly gets disrespected in every way imaginable, yet does nothing about it making us question how he could have possibly survived for this long in the Star Wars universe and how Darth Vader hired him as one of his most trusted, loyal and best bounty hunters in the entire galaxy???I didn't get ""Oh, I'm Boba Fett and a real badass"" vibes. No! I got ""Oh I am a balding, middle aged man with a cool uniform on, but the helmet is itchy, so I want to get a nice tan on my bald head in the open sun on Tatooine"" vibes!Sure, we got a beloved character back in the penultimate episode only for them to disrespect said character in the next episode. You know a show is bad when every single time the main character comes on, you start rolling your eyes hoping he would finally get killed, but knowing it's just not gonna happen! And isn't it wonderful to have a PG-rated version of the Sons of Anarchy in the Star Wars universe who are just about the most boring, uninteresting, annoying, frustrating and unlikeable characters?!Overall, The Book of Boba Fett is a series disrespecting the essence of Star Wars in so many ways and a lead who is completely incapable of handling his business by himself! Star Wars fans deserve so much better! It is amazing how all these words came out from someone whose favorite franchise of all time is Star Wars!

The action set pieces were well done, but the writing and acting for this one wasn't quite as good as the previous two episodes. Overall I can't give the series anything higher than a 6/10 because the first four episodes just weren't very good at all. Too little, too lateEdit 5 - episode 6 is another very strong one. Great engaging story, great acting, suspense and cast. It's still a shame that we had to go through 4 rubbish episodes for this series to become enjoyable. This week is an 8/10, but the series overall is still a 6.Edit 4 - well wadaya know, different cast, different director and all of a sudden we have an amazing episode. It's fairly annoying that the first episode without Boba Fett in it is by far the best one. On its own, this episode is 9/10. However, one good episode does not make a good series. Score bumped up to a 6Edit 3 - so episode 4 continues with the same general boredom, terrible dialogue and shoddy acting. They are ruining one the best characters in Star Wars.

But this first season has been a major disappointment.For a start, bad acting. I haven't seem much from Temura Morrison but if we have to judge by this series, he is a bad actor. He doesn't look convincing in the role. His performance is very stiff, and soon you get tired of seeing him doing the same poses and doing the same gestures again and again. Ming-Na Wen has the same problem. It seems she's always doing the same face and speaking in the same tone. I'm not seeing any acting range or changes in emotions. It seems they're always putting a lot of effort into trying to look ""cool"", and instead it looks silly.The other major problem is the plot. In The Mandalorian, the plot was easy to follow. We understood the character from the start. A bounty hunter, a loner. In The Book of Boba Fett, I can't really tell who Boba Fett is or what's his end goal. It seems like he's someone who has nothing, an old and tired soldier, but he behaves as if everyone should bow before him as if he were a king. At the same time, no one seems to respect him much and he keeps being tricked by almost anyone he meets.

tt13668894,ur65887769,7,10 February 2022,"The Book of Boba Fett was an odd first season. It seemed completely lost and lacking any real narrative direction in the first few episodes. When the season was hijacked by The Mandalorian it suddenly seemed to have purpose, drive and some sort of genuinely intriguing narrative.The show seems to do for Boba Fett what Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones do for Darth Vader, essentially demystify, in a fairly 'paint by numbers' way, a character beloved by fans of the original trilogy.The set-up for the next season of The Mandalorian works well and the moments between the two mature Jedi are touching enough without going too far.Essentially The Book of Boba Fett is least interesting when it focuses on the main character. The relationship with the township of Mos Espa isn't built effectively enough for the landing to stick in the finale and some of the poor action, acting, pacing and general story telling of the first 3 episodes was/is hard to recover from... but I would suggest that this is an enjoyable show overall. The fairground bike chase scene could've almost killed virtually any show and Boba just about survives.The inclusion of another fan favourite bounty Hunter from the extended universe brightens up the last two episodes but anyone not well versed in the animated shows will probably miss his significance to the lead character (a show about him may have been a more interesting endeavour).The rancor pays off (kind of) and there are some nice throwbacks to the Tattoine of SW lore but I think it would be fair to say the show couldn't/ wouldn't survive without Mando (and his related storyline/ characters).Boba Fett was and is many diehard StarWars fan's favourite character. Until recently he was still the character that sold the 3rd most merchandise behind Darth Vader and R2D2. Whether this is still the case following this softening and representation of the character remains to be seen.Really, Boba's story was already told in the guise of The Mandalorian. Without the popularity of the original Boba Fett there would be no Mando (or even Jango Fett). Most people saw The Mandalorian as a pseudo Boba and really it was just fear of damaging such a popular character that seemed to determine that Mando wasn't Boba (that and a paint job). Sadly this left no story for the actual Boba Fett by the time Disney had the guts to introduce him. It's probably fair to say that The Book of Boba Fett was left with nothing to really do with the 'man with no name gunslinger' because The Mandalorian had done it so well (with added sidekick and shinier armour).The Book of BobaFett is OK.

tt13668894,ur24381706,9,21 February 2022,"I really don't get why so many people didn't like this show.The reason I absolutely LOVED it was because it was 100% faithful to the SW universe in a way that not even the Mandalorian managed to be. Its pace felt completely Star Warsesesque (original trilogy), the occasional cheesy one-liners also felt like the original trilogy. Boba Fett was fantastic, I don't get why it's such a big deal that he removes his helmet, other people commented on this like it was really bad for the show, however while watching it I didn't even notice it.But even if we assume this is annoying, this series felt like a trip back to the original trilogy.We get to visit all these iconic locations, we get to see so many familiar characters and creatures, and though they could all be fan service, they all fit nicely in the story.In my opinion, SW fans may be a little too deep inside the SW universe and lore and may have forgotten that the three original movies were pretty straightforward stories with no twists, turns and whatnot. This is why the ""Luke, I am your father"" was such a big deal: nobody expected a twist, we just thought this would be a pretty basic good vs evil fantasy story in 3 parts.Anyway, I feel that the Book of Boba Fett was neither overlong nor slow in pace. The flashbacks were equally strong to the main story, plus we got to visit another side of very well known SW locations (doing my best to avoid spoilers), instead of seeing even more unknown planets, familiar only to people who have read all the comics, played all the games and watched all the animated series.In conclusion, the Book of Boba Fett stands out as the most loyal to the original trilogy movie or series made, as far as I'm concerned.I liked it better than Rogue One, and though the Mandalorian is fantastic in every aspect, I felt like this had a certain lightness and pace that made it more enjoyable over all, and definitely better than the Mandalorian's first season.I think people should try to remember that the original movies were primarily fun movies, with the funny droids, the silly jokes, the Muppet Show Ewoks, and Han Solo's one-liners.

The very first episode we get what is supposed to have been the galaxy's most feared bounty hunter getting his butt handed to him by sand natives (Tuskens). Now, you could say, well he was hurt from being in that sarlacc's stomach, but then he gets his butt handed to him again in the 2nd and 3rd episodes too. Plus he apparently sleeps in a bacta tank because, well, probably because he constantly gets his butt kicked.Then, he's quite the peaceful forgiving guy too - he takes over a ruthless crime lord's territory, but he refuses to kill people even after they've tried to kill him. He let's all of his enemies go after they've tried to kill him and frankly, it just seems odd - or perhaps DIsney.I'm not sure who actually wrote this - I see the names in the credits, but can't believe it personally. Not sure if Kathleen got her dirty mitts all over this or what, but the 3rd episode with the brightly colored boutique hover bikes ridden by the Little Rascals led by Darla practically screams that she did.There is literally so much wrong with this, that I doubt it gets a second season.

It is mostly boring been there, seen that, stuff that you'd expect out of poorly written TV drama on one of the networks.I'll watch every episode, just to see how bad it gets, and you will too - don't lie, but if this is any indicator of how the other shows are supposed to play out when they debut, then we're in for some horrible shows in the near future.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur20958383/?ref_=tt_urv

Positives:
1. Generally great visuals and atmosphere, an gives overall complete story.2. Fun call backs and cameos from new and old characters that adds some depth to the Mandalorian universe.Negatives:
1. As with Darth Vader, the backstory takes away much of what was great about the character of Boba Fett. The stoic badass Eastwood-eque character was at his most powerful in Empire when you knew the least about him. The prequals largely demolished the overall effect of both Vader and Fett. The Mandalorian is largely a complete recreation of who the Boba Fett character originally was. As a result, we already had this character in play and Boba Fett feels like either a redundancy or a completely unrelated and new character in the star wars universe.2. The Character of Fett gets a fairly complete story arc which is nice but if any character in the series should have been written off as a result, it was him. His story is finished. The actor is aged. He should have been given a heroes death and pass the baton if that was essence of the story.3. The introduction of Cad Bane is spectacularly good and disappointingly brief. I think the writers completely missed the mark here. Bane is easily the best unique characters to come out of the animated universe and to bring him in only to kill him after one and a half episodes was not only disappointing it was a huge mistake. Much like the death of Darth Maul, this was a character the story and fans had made an connection with and that we would have followed for years to come (imagine how much better the prequals would have been if Obi-Won as chasing and battling Darth Maul to avenge his master in the second film). Instead they had to introduce new villains and waste time trying to make us care about them just to fill the same role. I suspect this franchise will have to do the same, particularly if they are looking to anchor the next chapter around the Marshall and the cyborgs. People wanted to see more Bane instead will get more characters with less impact.",0,1,/user/ur17040088/?ref_=tt_urv
tt13668894,ur23527133,3,12 February 2022,I have to be honest and say that Disney Plus tv show record isn't very good worse is that there disrespecting the Star Wars universe for some reason they just seem to make the shows incredibly dull and boring there's no space battles there's no epic gun fights there's just a lot of talking and negotiating and desert planets at least with the Mandalorian there was a lot of action he was going into space quite a lot and it was interesting but the book of Boba Fett seems to slow everything down to a snails pace Bubba Fett is meant to come across as as a great and ruthless Bounty Hunter but in this series he is led b a female assassin who does all the talking for him this in my mind makes very weak.The introduction of the young crew aka the Power Rangers was one of the stupidest things that I ever saw in the show the Back Alley Street chase was awful but what I really don't like is that their bikes look like motorcycles and that is not part of the Star Wars universe that has no place in the starwars universe and having the young people in it just makes it cringy and I personally think that some of the dialogue is dumbed down I find it very insulting.The 2 best episodes were the Mandalorian episode and the episode with Luke Skywalker some people say that the CGI was terrible but it didn't bother me at all I personally think they needed the Mandalorian to save this show.I also must say that I am very disappointed that they killed off Cad Bane bringing him into live action was incredible and I love seeing him but killing him off in a last episode was just disgusting such a great character to die just like that very bad decision I would have liked to see his own series but Disney plus have no idea what they're doing so there you go.Overall I must say that I really don't understand why Disney plus make the decisions that they do because they clearly don't work yeah they may work for the younger generation but I'm going to be honest and say they don't work for me it seems to me that they're trying to wipe out everything that came before and put their own little spin on it thinking it will work well it doesn't you need to do better.,3,6,/user/ur23527133/?ref_=tt_urv

No way the Boba character established in the mentioned novel and throughout SW lore gets his armor striped by 3 foot Jawas, trampled by toddlers, ""apologizing"" to a dog for merely defending himself, or barely escaping inept thugs who weren't smart enough to sniper him in the head since he's roaming around helmet-less OUT IN THE OPEN. I mean how ridiculous was it for him to ever do that especially after being threatened. Case in point, in this show Boba is NOT presented as a character who stays one step ahead of his enemies, instills fear, well trained in hand to hand combat, or in any way shape or form trying to establish himself as a ""gangster/boss"" (I mean we all have to agree on that).

We're used to better, even on the small screen. The makeup effects are decidedly sub-par - most of them are little more than rubber masks, and in fairness to some of the criticisms I've read here, they do feel a little cosplay-y.

tt13668894,ur17977264,4,15 January 2022,"Spoilers Ahead!The show gets almost everything wrong. We start with Boba himself. This is Boba shortly after we see him in the Mandalorian. He was Badass in that show. Sinister and dangerous, yet a man with honour, with a code of respect. The last action we see of him in the Mandalorian was killing Bib Fortuna in cold blood and assuming his throne.Skip forward to this show, seemingly immediately after that scene, and it's a different character. Completely different. Right down to the way he's previously spoken. The helmet is never on, and to be honest that kinda makes him not feel so much Boba Fett. It's a completely new character to both look at, and listen to. This is jarring.Next is dialogue. It's very off. This is especially noticeable in the side cast. Despite a swathe of well know good actors, they are hamming it up and it all feels wrong. The language does not suit Star Wars. The gags are quite painful, and then they'll use the same one the next week. Appointment joke I'm looking at you. The Mayors Domo, the water seller, the biker gang. They're all just dreadful. They all feel out of place for Star Wars. I mean one of the London accent kids calls Boba Fett ""mate"" at one point, like he was arguing with him down the pub in Eastenders. This is not Star Wars language. The rest of it is also very poor. It either very flat straight forward information giving ""this person is doing this here"" or someone saying an absolutely painful gag in return. A gag they will reuse again. We're only 3 episodes in and we've had about 8 repeating gags and two door traps in the pit. For the love of god write something.Last but very, very much not least, Star Wars is built on its action, and this is some of the most sub rate action I have ever seen in my life. It's comically bad. Episode 2 directed by Seth Green certainly shows improvements in that regard. But both 1 and 3 directed by Rodrigues feel like he things he's making another Spy Kids.I wanted to love this show. TM is someone I have a lot of time for, and to be honest he is probably carrying this show hard. He's the only one with any kinda of charisma.But so far, 3 episodes in, I'm not sure I even care about next week. I'll watch it sure. Will I be eating on the timer on Wednesday like before?

That's the reason Boba doesn't seem as ""badass"" as he did in Empire, Jedi, etc.If they had made Boba more like what we had in mind about him he would've been just another Din Djarin and that would've been worse.That being said, the old man in me likes this version of Boba. Idealist, yet measured and with a wider openness to embrace the world he lives in.The first three episodes are superb and while I did enjoy seeing Luke again, I think they still need to do a LOT of damage control for what they did to him in Ep. 7, 8 & 9. We are supposed to cheer for him, Luke mf Skywalker, not fear that he's gonna slice Grogu if he has a bad dream. Maybe allow him to fully enter into his Yoda role and allow us to believe in him again.Also, why is Luke a master when Ahsoka isn't? She technically has more right to be called a master. But I don't know, I didn't saw the entire Clone wars cartoon.But I digress, The Book of Boba Fett while not as good as The Mandalorian is still a worthy entry in the Star Wars universe.P. S.

The train fight, tuskin culture and world building, and the action all top notch there, it's such a refreshing feel. Where the hell was that for the rest of it? And can we talk about that Godzilla vs Terminator BS at the end? Those robots didn't even feel like Star Wars, and the biker gang, why are they just intolerable? I tried giving them a chance, I can deal with their looks, but when everyone talks the same and they talk with these heavy European accents? Like it feels like they don't belong.

tt13668894,ur23903762,1,15 January 2022,"Bring back Star Wars for old people! Remember when Star Wars was this prestigious affair with some of the greatest creative talents in cinema, when the technical expertise in cinematography, film editing, art direction, sound design, sound editing, costume design shone so brightly along with charming screen personalities and screen chemistry that crackled on-screen? Remember how Star Wars got 11 Oscar nominations? Disney doesn't want your high expectations, or else how can they continue cranking out so much product? They also want you to forget Boba Fett was a mercenary killer, notorious as ""the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy"", just like most people forget Han Solo was a drug smuggler.Boba Fett was already wasted in Season 2 of The Mandalorian, with one chaotic action sequence to show off the hidden gadgets in his armour, against the laziest, most disposable fodder of comic relief Stormtroopers, and then he's reduced to playing the getaway driver for the remaining episodes. And yet even that waste is more entertaining than any single moment he gets in his own series.Boba Fett decides to continue wearing his bounty hunter armour while claiming the mantle of crime lord, and whatever reasons or outcomes you imagine from just hearing that, I assure you, are far more interesting than what this show offers. After three episodes of aimless absence of a storyline, the story is no further ahead than when it started. We've had the Tusken Raiders revisited again and again in flashback, with little to nothing learned that we didn't already get from one scene with them in The Mandalorian. Rubbery costumes, airbrushed sets, and the most embarrassing, sloppy, geriatric chase scene I've ever laid eyes on, which Fett only jumps into once it's over. Cosplay enthusiasts may rejoice that their to-do lists will get shorter and cost a lot less once this show's effect on Star Wars sinks in, but audiences are really getting cheated here. I see nothing in this show that could possibly lay the foundation of any sort of twist of revelation that's supposed to forgive or explain away the waste of time the first 3 episodes of this show have been, and no glimmer of hope that there's any salvation for this show or it's characters coming down the pipe.

This series is likely to annoy most fan boy's, particularly those with set ideas of who Boba Fett is and what happened to him after the Sarlacc Pitt. It's not that bad but if you want action packed bounty hunter show, then The Bad Batch is more likely what you want. I came to this free from expectations and that helps.What I liked.The best parts, so far, are the scenes with the Sandpeople. It's interesting, well written and you feel for the characters. I also got the feeling Temeura resonated with these parts as a Maori and having to deal with and dispel myths of his people.Ming-Na is good, but feel her character needs to be set free more.Episide 4 for me is where story comes together and the ""present"" and past click.What doesn't work for me.The early ""present"" scenes are poorly written and acted. So many cliches, uninteresting characters that are stale stereotypes. And while the casino/house of pleasure is better set here than in The Last Jedi, it is still so cliche and done better elsewhere.And this leads to another pet peeve. There are so many references to old movies and TV, and it's not really referential and interesting say as Tarantino does, it just seems too simple and often done better elsewhere.Most of the ""action"" scenes in the present are just not interesting. I mean Boba forgets he's got a jetpack when surrounded! And the ""chase"" scene involving the speeder and moped speeders is slow, predictable and pointless. I mean you could have jogged quicker.And the mods, at least at this point, are uninteresting and cliche riddled.Then there is scene with Boba and the other houses, yep seen that in every mob movie and lots of Batman. Nothing much happens just boring exposition and setting up war with the Pikes. I get why it was done, but again, better done elsewhere.It does pick up big time at the end of Ep 3 and ep 4 is pretty good.So overal this is ok and maybe good if you are an open minded Star Wars fan.

tt13668894,ur83460333,1,31 December 2021,"Boba Fett is a chump in this show. This episode spans a 5 year time gap, picking up both from Return of the Jedi and the last we saw Boba in the Mandalorian, flashing back and forth.Flashback 5 years earlier, we see Boba escaping from the Sarlacc that ate him in Return of the Jedi. He escapes only to be robbed and beaten by Jawas. The. He is revived by sand people (Tuscan Raiders), captured, and then beaten by sand children. Then he us beaten up by what appears to be a Sandwoman during an escape.In present time, Boba is constantly disrespected, and then beaten up by ninjas with energy shields. Fennec Shand helps him fight the ninjas but neither of them, a Bounty Hunter and Assassin have any skills to defeat these foes. Luckily, Boba's recently hired henchmen come to the rescue. After they disperse the ninjas they are able to kill some of them and then somehow Fennec is able to take in 2 all by herself while Boba is taken to safety.He does eventually kill a sand monster, but it was because it was distracted and her had a chain to choke it from behind.Boba Fett is supposed to be a 41 year old man, but is played by a 61 year old man, who looks elderly and slow. I don't really care about his age, but he's not playing the character as one who should be in the prime of his life. I think the producers used the actor who played Jango Fett in the Prequels for the nostalgia / fanfare aspect, but never took the characters actual age into consideration.Boba Fett is supposed to be the best Bounty Hunter in the galaxy, but he has no fighting skills in the first episode, no wits, no personality, no nothing to make him an interesting character. Rather he looks like the chump who was accidentally ""killed"" by a blind Han Solo in Return of the Jedi. He doesn't use his armor, weapons and jet pack in anyway when attacked in the street except to blow up a middle in his own face.This Boba Fett is weak, the pacing is slow, and the acting is subpar.

Book of Boba Fett was an embarrassment from start to finish. The focus was all over the place, and even completely abandoned Boba Fett and it's plot to instead be season 3 of The Mandalorian filled with over-bloated fan service nostalgic galore. 2 whole episodes dedicated to developing Mando further with very little to nothing to do with the plot of BBF. Boba Fett was probably the worst crime lord ever. His motivations and reasons to be the crime lord of Tatooine are never covered. As crime lord his plan is to stop all crime including all profiting from criminal business, which would include his own profiting. The idea of this being a Boba who has out lived his father and is now having to deal with being a older man is never addressed. Instead, he states how he grew up surrounded by water. All the assassins in this are terrible at assassinating, especially when no one brings a gun or weapon to the assassination attempt. The cyberpunk kids who claim to be poor without work are the worst, and are definitely not poor. Rather than going on a journey to redemption, the first minute Fett appears on screen he is immediately no longer the once villain we always knew him to be. He is now a good guy. Tusken Raiders, who kidnap, beat and torture, enslaved, and nearly kill Fett, are now good guys. Mando needs a new transport vehicle and instead gets a N1 starfighter with no room for anything, and plays no role in Book of Boba Fett. Boba escapes the pit using his armor, crawls to safety where Jawas steal his armor. Later Fett thinks he left his armor inside the pit. Beskar is stated to be used to make only defensive armor, except beskar was used to make whistling birds in Mandalorian by the same the person who now claims the opposite. Luke Skywalker forces a BABY to make a critical life decision...again a BABY. Luke also believes detachment is the way of the Jedi Order despite knowing detachments played a key role in the tragic massacre from his father. The main enemy should've easily have been the Hutts. Instead it's the Pykes with a war-like conflict that was completely shoehorned into the show without any build up or understanding as to why spice trade on Tatooine is bad and whether or not an entire planet is against it.... Doubt it. Instead of going with Boba's logical idea to fight a final battle using Jabba's palace where they could see every enemy coming at them, they go with cyberpunk girl's suggestion to fight inside a destroyed bar surrounded by buildings where they are unable to see who or what is coming at them.Nothing in Book in Boba Fett made sense.The blame for this show's constant stupidity is on the head writer, creator, and top listed executive producer...Jon Favreau.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur69653175/?ref_=tt_urv

It's slow, but enjoyable, where we can see Boba Fett's flashbacks of for example when he is escaping the Sarlacc, right after Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, and becoming a family member of the Tusken Raiders, but lost them shortly after. I liked this part, because this is something deep with Boba Fett's life. But suddenly, we get our attention to another character - Din Djarin, and he is carrying the show for two whole episodes almost without Boba Fett. This is what disappoints me the most. I enjoy seeing other familiar characters, but when the title of the show is ""The Book of Boba Fett"", I expect to see Boba Fett in every episode, and keep my excitement for him. I almost forgot Boba Fett when following Din Djarin in episode 5 and 6, and that is not right. I think these episodes don't belong to this show, because it made very little difference to the story. The show concluded in an ok way, but I'm not satisfied.Temuera Morrison still fits the Star Wars universe, and stays well in his role - Boba Fett. I personally don't think Ming-Na Wen is a good actress, because she is overacting.Otherwise, the show has good visuals. The FX is mostly good, and the lighting is also great.

The visuals were generally stunning, but everything with the Scooter Gang was pretty bad.So I would still recommend this to Stars Wars fans, but it is definitely not the best TV that I've watched and would probably not draw in viewers that were not already fans of the franchise.

The show started off by sparking intrigue as we all wanted to know how Boba Fett escaped the sarlacc pit and survived that encounter. The Book of Boba Fett seems to brush past this and begin developing Fett by displaying a side to him that we had never seen before. He isnt as ""bad-ass"" as many expected him to be as he still deals a considerable amount of damage however, his morals have been altered in this serie. He no longer strives to be a ruthless Bounty Hunter as a few lessons that he has picked upon teach him that family means more. Due to this, Boba ops to fill in the throne left vacant by Jabba The Hut in order to protect the local kingdom.I mentioned that the serie was a rollercoaster, this is not to be taken lightly as eps 1-2 are solid and necessary, eps 3-4 begin to stall progression and only serve the purpose of brewing tentions in Mos Espa. Whereas eps 5-6 are a true high as the width of the Star Wars galaxy is utilised to enlighten Star Wars fans aswell as using this to add to the episodes rather than just providing a brief supply of fan service. Yet ep 7 was a failure for me, the worst parts of the show re-emerge.

Numerous subsequent films and shows have successfully erased this character history and rebranded him a hero and made him basically one of the main faces of the Star Wars universe (because, you know, there's only so many cool characters from the original films to work with, and the creatively bankrupt corporate SW entity needs to stretch every last mile out of this franchise).I was hoping, at least, that maybe we could expect a more edgy, more sinister character, going back to his roots in this series, but nope (stupid hope, admittedly, seeing how this is Disney after all). The series follows Boba's attempt to become a crime lord. Not a drug dealing, slaving, murdering crime lord of course, but a good, honorable, respected crime lord....whatever that could possibly be. Why not just start your own ice cream business on a desert planet, Bobs? Why get involved in crime at all? These scenes are intercut with a bunch of badly done background scenes of Boba escaping the sarlac pitt and falling in with a band of Sand people. The plot is entirely predictable: yes, at first he's capture by them and eventually earns their respect and eventually becomes one of the most respected members of their tribe. Literally the most obvious route you could go with that plot. Hey, how about he goes to war single handidly with them and against a criminal organization at the same time? It would fit his nefarious background, and maybe even be an interesting story.By the way, can I say just how much I am sick of Tusken Raiders? It's been overdone, they're not very interesting, and their ""HHHAAAAARRRK""ing is getting very annoying.As far as production, it's not a well made show. The acting is pretty poor and most everybody in the series has a midwestern american accent for some reason, the original movies made great pains to give everyone interesting accents, inventing languages of its own, and making character's voices downright cool, this series throws that out the window. The practical effects, makeup and costumes all look corny and low effort, everybody in the series looks like a bunch of kids playing star wars, rather than being actual star wars.Final complaints that I began to notice in The Mandalorian, and see here even worse. Could these characters please STOP STRUTTING when they walk? Walk normally, and another thing, when did Star Wars become the Matrix, where a Kung Fu fight breaks out every 4 minutes? You have high tech guns, you'd think you could use those.Also, doesn't it seem like Fett's jet pack could basically solve like every tricky situation he finds himself in?*Edit*
After finishing the series, I really have nothing to add; besides asking the question: why is this show called ""The Book of Boba Fett""? It has nothing to do with a book, and very little to do with Boba Fett.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur3940346/?ref_=tt_urv

For all the money they spend.....you'd think it would be better. I don't know....maybe for Star Wars to work it just needs that big screen feel. What we get is a show that feels like something from the 80s. The writing is pretty terrible. It's basic nature stems from the animated Clone series it's modeled after. Staying confidently in or below PG territory. I'd say the acting is bad, but the lines they give the actors are pretty cringe-so it's hard to say who's fault it is. And the directing is not great either so add that to the mix. But the amateurish nature is from top to bottom. Even the extras feel cheesy. Maybe it all comes down to budget-and they do what they can. This is more a critique of all Disney+ shows but Boba is no better. Worse in some cases. Some of the creative decisions are head scratching to say the least. Space teenagers and space Vespas come immediately to mind. Boba is a show that sometimes features Boba Fet! Which seems like the writers admitting that their story and main character isn't interesting enough on his own. And they are right. Lucas killed Darth Vader's legacy and Disney killed pretty much everyone else's legacy. And they are doing a good job of doing the same for Boba. I could have easily stopped watching half way through as I was certain that my level of interest would not go up- and after watching the remaining episodes, I confirmed my suspicions. Boba is a show. That's about the highest praise I can give it. It's a solid 4- but I gave it an extra point because they spent so much money on it. And that makes me sad. I'm not excited for really any other Star Wars show coming up in the future as I already know what to expect-uninteresting, bland meh.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur40409916/?ref_=tt_urv

tt13668894,ur45921683,3,10 February 2022,"This is another Disney blunder that leaves me scratching my head why it was even made. Disregarding the two episodes that are just Mandalorian episodes, it seems like Disney would only let this show be made on a shoe string budget. Everything feels empty and like a tv set from the 80s. The main plot is so basic, and character motivations make no sense. But then why spend any money making this if there is no story? You could have used the budget for the Mandalorian, or Ahsoka? I might understand the thin budget if Disney did not have confidence in the series, but why then tack in two Mandalorian episodes that are mandatory viewing before season 3.If I were to just read the script for this I would assume it was written in an hour by an amateur who has only a slight knowledge of Star Wars, not Jon Favreau. The show has no stakes, and the plot can be explained in one sentence. There is so much material about the crime syndicate, and bounty hunters to pull from the EU, or the comics. Not only that but there was a scraped Boba Fett movie. Was this actually the plot to that? This story could barely pass for a baby book, let alone a movie or tv series. For the sake of Star Wars I hope Jon Favreau was forced by Disney to make this, and just scratched down the first thing he thought of.Here are some obvious questions one would have watching this show. Why did Boba kill Bib and want to take over Jaba's empire? What happened to Jaba's empire, there is no one in the palace? Why is Boba the Bounty Hunter a complete push over now? What happened to all of Boba's bounty hunter contacts? Why is Boba's only ally Fennic Shand after a life time of working as a bounty hunter? Why would Boba care about keeping the spice out of tatooine, or about tatooine at all? Why did Boba take over Jaba's operations, and seemingly want nothing to do with any crime activity? Where did all the Tuskans go? The pykes only killed off that one tribe, surely they have a stake with Boba taking over. Why does Boba not hire any mercenaries with his newly acquired fortune? His allys are literally a small town, and a teenage gang he just met. Where is all the infrastructure from Jaba's crime empire that Boba apparently took over? Why does the final fight with the Pykes feel like a street quarrel when every member of the five syndicate has delt with Boba Fett? Surely they would want to know whats going on with Boba?This is currently the #1 tv show after the finale. None of the plot from the two Mandalorian episodes had anything to do with the main plot. The ""A"" plot of the story is non existent, basically these people are going to fight these people for a big fight scenes. The whole final battle actually felt kind of lame because they had no budget for anything else other than the Rancor. I can only think that some executive demanded grogu be in the final battle, so they tacked in two episodes of the Mandalorian to explain that. Between the two Mandalorian episodes, and the flashbacks, the main plot maybe had half an episode to be explained.The Mandalorian episodes were fantastic, but why put those in if they have nothing to do with the Boba Fett Story. I thought they were trying to setup Boba attaining the darksaber, but the only thing that happened in the final was Grogu showed up.This show is a waste of time.

tt13668894,ur64714313,3,9 February 2022,"The strongest thing this show had going for it was expansion on the Jedi Order post TLJ and some bridge between The Mandalorian S2 and S3. Other than that, this show offers very little. It has good fan service now and then as a nod to other films and shows but it's lackluster when compared to other works. It has 3 strong episodes out of the 7 and the ending is mediocre at best. The ending can be best described as a Star Wars version of the Avengers, there are some good shots and some decent action sequences but the acting and writing are absolutely awful. When you compare this to the Clone Wars ending or Mandalorian S2 ending, it's not even close. The mega droidekas make for a really boring addition to the story because that's where the fighting should end. There's no stakes at all because everyone's plot armor is impenetrable. The only character that gets killed off who I cared about was Cad Bane and that's because of his build-up from the Clone Wars. Not a single character introduced in this show was developed, they could have all died and the plot wouldn't have been changed. The rancor scenes might as well had made the writers change the episode's name to Godzilla vs Mech-Godzilla featuring King Kong. By every measure, the Mandalorian should be dead, but nothing happens to him because of his plot armor. Then somehow a bunch of people get sniped through a building with almost no windows, someone gets hanged and someone gets stabbed? Did no one read this script? At the end of the episode, the town is destroyed by a rampaging rancor but then everyone bows at Boba? Somehow the Cyberpunk edgy teens live? If the show hadn't ended with Mando flying off with Grogu then it would have left an even sourer taste in my mouth.It's really sad that they were able to take a fan favorite character like Boba Fett and ruin his story with a cheap cash grab.

The character just lacks the gravitas and toughness I would have expected. His sidekick played brilliantly by Ming Na Wen comes across far tougher and more expert in combat. Surely Boba should be the ultimate tough guy, even perhaps more than our beloved mandalorian ?My suspicions were first raised in the mandalorian when Boba failed to beat a young mandalorian woman in hand to hand combat.

That's it?!"".I really want to like this series but the pacing and story overall just isn't captivating. In nearly every episode there's a reference/callback to something - for fan service/to help sell more toys with absolutely zero premise.I'm all for nostalgia/callbacks to expand the world and make it even bigger but there NEEDS to be story. There needs to be RISKS/STAKES. There needs to be a reason for your audience to actually CARE about your characters. Yet alone your MAIN CHARACTER!!!!At this point... Boba's character is very laughable and weak.I would love nothing more than to see Boba riding a Reincore destroying everything in his path but...?The thing that killed me was the Mandalorian episode (episode 5). Overall... FANTASTIC episode! However, did that particular story REALLY need to be told right now? No. Is it nice context/filler? Sure. Could we have skipped it and brought Mando right into the conflict that we left off with from the previous episode? ABSOLUTELY! Which is exactly what SHOULD have happened.This series constantly jumps around in timelines and not only does it make the whole story feel messy but it also doesn't allow that chance for your audience to REALLY connect/care.I'm happy to see Mando's continuing story but the fact that you have to bring in the MANDALORIAN to save your franchise/show and completely ride on that....? Nah.Literally episode 5 does not feature Boba Fett at all and by how episode 6 is setup it doesn't seem like we'll see much of him either at this point.I hope I'm wrong and I hope for the series to get better but as of right now... it's a dud compared to its predecessor.",53,61,/user/ur45915659/?ref_=tt_urv

So basically Jon Favreau had this awesome character to do anything he wanted with, but couldn't think of much to do with him. Its a lot like the Lucasfilm story group not knowing what to do with Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo after The Force Awakens. There seems to be a dire lack of imagination at that place. So to try and hide this lack of anything, story-wise, they hired Robert Rodriguez for 3 of the 5 Boba eps, in an attempt to mask it with action scenes. This is where the really went wrong. Rodriguez is more comparable here to Spy Kids, than Desperado. He just doesn't fit the Star Wars style. Any of the other Mando directors would've been better.

tt13668894,ur64414071,10,6 January 2022,"I'll start off here with the obvious elephant in the room. There are basically two types of Star Wars fans. Those who love the romantic hero driven universe of light sabers, the force, the rebellion, the empire and good vs evil and those who love the Star Wars universe itself along with all the other stories it has to offer.The Book of Boba Fett pays homage to the latter. It gives us a deep dive into legendary characters and tribes along with fleshing out the planet that the Star Wars stories originally began upon. 2 episodes in and I've learned more Star Wars history than I have since I sat in the theatre as a mesmerized 5 year old boy seeing George Lucas' epic space western for the first time.Don't get it twisted. This isn't an action packed, force powered thrill ride. This is a long overdue drama set in the vast universe full of lore that fills in many blanks. Some of which we never realized were even mysteries. Fett may be physical shell of the bounty hunter he once was in his formative years but it's obvious he's learned from his near death experiences and gained wisdom and patience through his many trials since his ignominious pseudo death in ROTJ. Don't confuse his new found persona with weakness though. This iteration of our favorite bounty hunter still has sharp teeth but now has the experience to know better when to use them.The backstory, easter eggs and nods to Original Trilogy canon is nirvana to us geeks who read the novels and dominated all of our friends and family in SW Trivial Pursuit during the long dearth of SW movie and TV content. From Hutt cousins laying claim to Jabba's crime empire, Trandoshans drinking tea at an outdoor cafe, an Ithorian (hammerhead) as mayor of Mos Espa, a gang of Weequay raiders and Max Rebo getting a new club gig all the way to a Wookie assassin working for the aforementioned Hutts. This show delivers the Star Wars goods in spades. No force or lightsabers? Who cares?!I feel truly bad for those who can't appreciate such an in depth homage to a beautifully crafted universe with endless storytelling possibilities because it doesn't fit their personal Star Wars narrative.

Boba is portrayed, in his own show, as a very stupid person. Although the performance by Temora is nothing short of great. The story's pacing, and structure are also huge problems. Some of the side characters are ridiculous and totally out of place, making no sense as to why they're included. The setups and payoffs are poorly conceived.

It was also one of the best-lit ""guts"" of a lifeform I have ever scene (at least in Empire the inside of the giant worm was dark). The decaying storm trooper inside the Sarlacc pit seemed pointless. Perhaps it was a storm trooper that fell in when searching for the droids in A New Hope, but that is REALLY stretching things.I can understand his jetpack not working after Han accidentally hit it, but somehow he punched and burned his way through the Sarlacc to get to the surface? No, just no. (smh)The fight in the town center was ridiculous and already shows that the writing for this series will be weak. The two main characters, Boba and Fennec, find themselves surrounded and must fight their way out. Apparently their fighting skills only work at climatic points in the story, because their fight seemed like a huge beat-down until their guards saved them. Fennec could dodge a blaster bolt and take down storm troopers like training dummies (well, they are always easy to kill, except when the story needs them to be competent), but now suddenly she isn't smart or skilled enough to realize the red glowy shields are too powerful to get past? Did the shields sap her of her fighting skills? Did all of Boba's possible weapons run out of power too?The flashbacks Boba has during the episode seem like a bit too much fluff and filler. If this series is going to be about episodic flashbacks, I'll abandon it now before Boba Fett turns into ""Arrow"" seasons 2-7. I get showing people the first few weeks of surviving, but the ""oh, Sand People are just misunderstood"" bit was ridiculous.

The main goal in The Mandalorian is to reunite Grogu ""with his own folk"" but given how The Book of Boba ended by Grogu choosing to be with Mando the stories ""hurt themselves in their confusion"" ;) .Having Grogu coming back just like that has no depth at all and minimises all the sacrifices that Mando went by taking, protecting and leaving him (2 times!) with Luke with whom Grogu would've probably become the most powerful Force user if not also a natural Jedi Master in a fiction world called Star Wars where the main story is the eternal battle between the Dark side of the Force and the Light.. Loosing the Tuskens doesn´t explain how an orphan child that had already endured seeing his father getting killed and grew up as a bounty hunter suddenly decides to be a do gooder ""crimelord"" (daimyo) king of the working class and the poor while charging for protection. Maybe instead he should've tried to be the mayor of Mos Espa. Again the story ""hurt it self in it's confusion"".5/10. Not all was bad, clearly they have the means needed to do more and better.

I think this season made me more excited for The Mandalorian season 3 rather than The Book of Boba Fett season 2 (if there will be). There were too many times where the director or producer or whoever chose to keep elements that seem very out of place. An example of this is the first episode with the monster that looked like a Pokémon, and not a creature you'd find on Tatooine. Another example was the teenage biker gang. Their costumes made them look like they're from a steam punk band in England and not in Star Wars. Terrible costume execution, their robotic parts looked like a Halloween costume decoration rather than being part of the characters. They really liked to highlight the main British biker girl who looked like a wannabe Joan Jett. The blondie in the biker gang looked like a preppy school boy, and was dressed like one too. They tried so hard to make them look cool on vespas (that looked like they could barely pass being transportation on Coruscant). Those vespas were way too shiny and vibrant for being on Tatooine, let alone in Star Wars. Although these may seem like small details to the directors or producers or whoever chose to do this, it takes away from the entire show and experience of Star Wars. I can't tell if it was the writing, acting, directing, or producing that was the most disappointing aspect of this TV Show, I guess all four. Who decided to make Boba Fett so weak? Yes he might be old, he's gone through some challenging trials, but everyone seemed to be kicking his butt. He's supposed to be this big bad bounty hunter, but this season proved otherwise. Then finally he was able to defeat Cad Bane using the techniques he learned from the sand people? Well, then Cad Bane must've really lost his game, to be defeated by this Boba Fett, because it seems like anyone can kick his butt.

This has been some of the worst star wars content I've seen since the Sequels, just a mindless, directionless mess. Let's go over some key flaws with this show.1. The main character disappears for two straight episodes and the show gets taken over by characters from a different show.2. Boba becoming friends with savages who enslaved him and treated him like trash doesn't make any sense. The Tuskens flashbacks were ultimately pointless too since Boba doesn't even avenge them, Fennec does.3. Bane, the only interesting antagonist, showed up too late and his conflict with Boba is barely developed, he should've been the main antagonist from the start. He's killed almost immediately after he's shown.4. The biker gang is terrible, their mopeds look ridiculous and the ""high speed"" chase is one of the worst sequences I've ever seen in any star wars iteration.5. Boba suddenly becomes a nice guy who wants to ""leave his old ways behind"" while simultaneously trying to become a crime lord, it's a blatant contradiction. He also becomes a fool who lets everyone disrespect him, Fennec essentially has to take his hand and guide him through being a daimyo, as if he wasn't one of the deadliest bounty hunters ever.6. We are shown zero development between Boba and the rancor he apparently learned to ride offscreen. The same rancor who destroys half the city he supposedly wants to protect.7. He is shown leaving the sarlacc pit with his armor on, and then later on he has to go back to the sarlacc Pitt because he needs his armor??? Did it fall back in after he got out? LOL.8. The idiotic sequence with the giant droids missing every single shot when there's a crowd of people on the street right in front of them.9. The best episodes had nothing to do with the actual protagonist or his story.10. The Boba shown in mando season 2 is a bad*ss who doesn't tolerate disrespect and kills with zero hesitation, yet in his own show he's turned into a wimp. And what happens in mando season 2 is set well after the tusken flashbacks where he apparently ""changed his ways"", wait, do you mean to tell me there's no consistency in this show as well?11. The worst part of all, they focus on Grogu and Mando's story in a show that isn't about them, and to top it all off, they bring Grogu back from training with Luke, after we just watched 2 seasons of Mando trying to return Grogu to ""his own kind"", guess his return only lasted a few weeks huh? It essentially made the first 2 seasons of The Mandalorian pointless, and for those who don't watch this show, Grogu will inexplicably be back with Mando at the start of the third season. So we finish off the second season with a goodbye and start the third season with a reunion? Give me a break!What a major disappointment, Favreu and Filoni seriously dropped the ball.

Boy was I wrong.The worst aspects from The Mandalorian seemed to be amplified to the max here. The writing for the most part is pretty poor and underwhelming. The story doesn't really go anywhere for a while and when it eventually does go somewhere it's not great. The episodes directed by Robert Rodriguez are unbearably bad. The action is horrific and amateurish and what you'd expect from someone who directed Spy Kids/We Can Be Heroes. The vespa crew are one of the worst things to be introduced to Star Wars in it's history. I had nothing against Rodriguez before but I certainly don't like the idea of him being involved with Star Wars again. There's so many other directors who would do a million times better.Episodes 5/6 were exceptional but I don't consider them to be part of TBOBF as Boba isn't in them. They're more like Mandalorian specials and keep me optimistic that Mando season 3 will still be really good.I think the worst part of all of this is what they did with Boba Fett. They made him too passive and soft. He tries to appease everyone and then blabbers about how strong and tough he is when almost everything he does in the show contradicts that. Just from watching the show you wouldn't know he was once the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy. I see what they wanted to do and I'm fine with Fett changing and being more of a hero but they should have had kept his tough side, someone who is strong willed and doesn't bow down to anyone. Fett never really had much of a character but he had huge potential, it was sorely wasted.I went into the show looking forward to every scene with Boba Fett in it, but by the finale I was dreading every frame he was in.

I was curious too, but it seems with all of the creators good intentions this series is a little weaker than the Mandalorian. The Story, the concept itself is ok, but the realisation is not the best. I kind of felt like this is a cheaper version of Mandalorian although this should be way more, since this guy should be tougher than Mando. We are talking about Boba Fett, who survived so much in this universe. The portrayal in the Mandalorian was better. The actor Temuera was right: he does not need to talk that much. The whole mistery about the character is losing it's charm. He should have kept his helmet on when walking in the city - The idea that he takes of the helmet in the place where the most criminal peole of the universe gather was not a clever choice from the creators. It is like if Batman would take off the Mask in the city telling the people "" no worries guys you are under my protection"" - I think this was bad choice. In Jabbas palace among his crew it is ok to take off the mask. His Mask Is a Symbol, his enemies should fear and others should respect. I don't know how but the episodes which Rodriguez directed where the lowest point of the series. The action scenes where just not well choreographed. The editing was slow -which made the action scenes worse. The story is good, just Those episodes where really really bad and cheap looking. Ok the worst scene was not clearly where Majordomo is chased by the young guys - Majordomo is the cheesiest part of the series. He just does not fit in this universe. Too human and too american. In a different show he would be ok. Maybe more prostetics or contact lenses he would have a more alien look, but the acting was too human like. Besides these the best episode was clearly until now episode 5 with the direction of Bryce Dallas Howard - clearly she has her fathers good sense to direct. I loved each minute, and that episode had a really good atmosphere. Hope that the creators of the series will focus more on the quality in the next season and also to try to focus on what your audience wants to see as in the end of the day you are living from us. A re-edited version of the first 3 episodes would be not a bad choice.

Throughout (canon) comics and novelizations, he was extremely noble and honorable, like when he was offered to...y'know...with Leia by Jabba the Hutt and just let her sleep on his bed instead, opting to sleep on the floor.

This peculiar pattern happened again with his involved in Star Wars, The Mandalorian (2019) and The Book of Boba Fett (2021).The Mandalorian was the best of Disney SW as the show explore the vast galaxy and introduce us with new and old beloved characters. It also dig deep with Mando's identity and his relationship with Grogu, so it got both intrigue and intimacy. The story of The Book of Boba Fett, on the other hand, mostly stayed on Tatooine (not including Mando's episodes), and the showrunners were struggling to bring out the intrigue and intimacy within Boba and Tatooine's inhabitants (Tuskens, Mods). Calling the show Chocolate chip cookie mixed with raisin is because there were beautiful moments within episodes 2 and 5. One explore the Tusken's culture and Boba's past, the other introduced Boba's mentor and rival Cad Bane. They hinted at the possible depth of this show, but the Tusken tribe and Bane were basically became minor plot points in the next episode (3, 7). The Entire Tusken tribe got eliminated off screen and Bane got ""killed"" in the last few minutes of the finale. There is no depth, not enough intrigue and intimacy.Is the show still enjoyable? Yes, it is, but you will always be distracted by elements that are less aesthetically pleasing: the flaws within the narratives, Boba's characterizations, the directors' quirky input (Vespa).

The CGI with the massiff wasn't bad CGI until the action came after it gained consciousness and started chasing Boba taking him down.BUT I DID enjoy the scenes with the sand people, those were my favorite. Most viewers see a whole different side of them because they seemed more organized and complex than your usual gang of raiders. That is what gives me hope in this series. The character development.

The state he was in still being able to speak and break his ropes and fight was too unrealistic for me and makes it feel a bit ""showey"".Boba was too nice overall, he's a ruthless assassin not a nice guy. Needs to be more of a grey character. An anti hero. The character maybe has good overall intentions now, but his means to the end should be things someone on the ""light"" side wouldn't do. Doubt he would offer to free the other person tied up in the camp.Boba also doesn't need the inner workings of tattoine criminal hierarchy and eticate explained to him, find a better way of conveying that information not just through unbelievable exposition.

Just really and truly astounding on every level. God damn they're good!!!Pick a topic, any topic ... the quality of the writing far surpasses anything you'd expect for the genre? Check. The musical score is new, engaging, unique and evocative (and dare I say is on a level with the original score the first time we heard it)? Check. The pioneering, groundbreaking new functionality of ""the Volume"" and what it gives them the ability to create? Check. Pushing the limits on what you can do with practical versus CGI (true to Lucas' legacy)? Check. Character (and cultural) development that is deep, intricate, thoughtful, intense, vulnerable ... and gives our suspension of disbelief a bold new footing? Check. Wardrobe that feels real, props that seem probable, towns you could see yourself walking through? Check.They've given this universe a depth and texture I'm willing to bet 90% of Star Wars fans have never seen, heard of or imagined. In fact, the truest thing I've heard many people say is whether you like Star Wars or not these series are fun and interesting to watch. Touchdown LucasFilm!For extra juicy fan service they even found a way to bring Black Krrsantan from the comics and Camie & Fixer from Tosche Station to life (and found a way to work in Stephen Root AND Danny effing Trejo FFS!).These two Series are proof positive of what you get when you hand the reins over to someone who is a serious, hardcore, lifelong fan ... whose goal is to show sincere passion, care and respect for this thing while still pushing it to new heights and into new places it's never gone before ... versus giving the reins over to studio marketing execs whose goal is to sell sponsorships, advertising, wearables and toys.God bless Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni! God bless the Crews that work with them and the Producers that make it all possible! They have given Star Wars back to the fans. Instead of just looking backward with aching nostalgia for what once was when we were kids (and maybe too young to fully appreciate it) ... now our imaginations are reignited with what might be (as grown ass adults!) ... and that's a beautiful thing to be a part of and an even more beautiful time to be alive!If you haven't watched them yet ... fix that.

Especially when Boba is an old guy past his prime with annoyingly white phony-teeth learning to line-dance with a Bantha stick. I have never been a huge fan of Temuera Morrison, he had edge in the 90's but acting has never been his strong suits and still isn't. He simply can't hold his own as a lead character, let alone an action lead like Boba. Yes he was Boba's ""father"" in Episode II, but that does not justify to build an entire show around him. Regrettably it is laughably and painful to watch Temuera learning to fight with a stick and the bonfire dance with the Sandpeople was extremely stupid! But wait isn't Boba the Galaxy's baddest bounty hunter?

tt13668894,ur87805425,6,13 February 2022,"After the success of The Mandalorian, Disney was set on milking that success dry. The first step was to give a spin-off show to one of the most popular characters in the star wars canon. I for one was looking forward to a TV show about Boba Fett, especially after Mando season 2 which ended with him becoming a crime lord. It felt like a logical direction for the character and I thought it would be interesting to see how ruthless he would be. Oh how wrong I was.The first half of this show Boba Fett is in a bacta tank. He does a few things as a crime lord but none of it is any interesting. Most of the first 4 episodes are taken up with how Boba Fett escaped the sarlacc pit, got taken in by Tusken raiders, became one of them only to have them murdered, meeting Fennec and getting his ship back. And if you thought this all of this would lead somewhere, nope. He's healed by episode 4 and that is it. This plot feels hastily cobbelled together and nothing much really happens. There's enough for maybe 3 episodes, not seven. Episodes 5 and 6 are massive detours where Boba Fett doesn't even appear and instead focuses on Mando. While I personally have no problem with Mando being here, this is the Book of Boba Fett, not Mandalorian season 2.5.The biggest disappointment of this series is Bob's Fett himself who has been completely disneyfied. No longer is he the cold, calculated hunter who would kill anyone who got in his way. Now he's a caring ruler, who doesn't care about money and never makes his own decisions. Honestly Fennec would make a better crime lord. She seems to be the most competent character in the show.I mentioned earlier that The Mandalorian shows up and when he does, the show gets much better. His storyline actually has emotion and heart in it as if that's what the writers really wanted to write about rather than Boba Fett. His episodes are filled with some egregious fan service however, but it is done mostly well but it should be in Mandalorian season 3, not here.While the effects and creature design is still top notch, the action is possibly the worst I've seen in Star Wars. Nothing makes sense, it's slow, boring and the strategies involved are laughable. The worst has to be the chase scene in episode 3 which is absolutely embarrassing. Not only do you have these stupid looking cyborgs who are really out of place and terrible characters in their own right, but also their crappy moped speeders that are too bright and colourful to be on Tatooine. It's terrible.Overall, The Book of Boba Fett did not need to be made and is worse for its existence. The show is at its best when Boba Fett isn't around, Boba Fett himself is completely character assasinated, and the action is mostly awful. The biggest concern is that this will be essential viewing for those waiting for Mandalorian season 3 as big plot events that should've happened in that show are shoved in here as if the writers knew this show wasn't interesting enough. If you love everything Star Wars then it might be right for you but I wouldn't recommend it for casual viewers.

That first episode would've greatly benefited from having the narrator from the Clone Wars series drop by to explain to us what's going on. But, overall, this is a good start.PRO - Setting the stage: that first episode does a good job at setting up the things that will follow. Basically, Boba Fett is taking over Jabba's criminal operations (after he disposed of Bib Fortuna, who had taken over after Jabba's death in Return of the Jedi). Boba is making the rounds, trying to impose himself as the new Crimelord in Mos Eisley... and is having moderate success. Also, Boba seems to require spending a lot of time in a bacta tank (medical tank filled with a liquid with regenerative properties). Why is that?PRO - Action scenes: The battle scenes are well executed and are rather impressive.PRO - Cantina scene: Ok, I have to admit, that one made me laugh.CON - Pacing imbalance: I've noticed that the pacing is more than a bit off, in that first episode. Per example, the scene inside the Sarlacc should've been longer and contain more action, while the storyline with the Sand People should've been much shorter. In fact, the Sarlacc scene would've been the Highlight of that episode (if not of the series) if it had been done properly... I have a feeling that the Sarlacc scene was that short because of bugdet issues.CON - Anti-hero - the most difficult character to write: Some of the audience (aka the casual fans I watched this with) were confused by Boba's actions. Isn't he a bad guy? If he wants to be a Crimelord, why is he trying to be nice about it? That's not how criminal organizations work... I get where the producers want to go, but making Boba too ""nice"" is playing against them.I will continue watching this series with interest.

Maybe in the future the two shows will be further separated, one series to cover each of the two storylines. If that is the case then it is very exciting due to the extra content, but at this point it feels like we are going to get alternating seasons of Boba and Mando each continuing the same tale.

Huh, I guess she fights better alone.The fight scenes with Boba, remind me of Jake from Once Were Warriors; big, dumb, with lots of anger, and little thought.Overall, the story kinda drags; maybe it will pick up later, but for now it seems all over the place. His right of passage with the Tuskens was a little goofy, like an American Indian rain dance, combined with African fertility dance. At least he finally got some clothes since he was probably almost out of sunblock.I'll give it a couple more episodes before I throw in the towel.

The flashbacks to the Tusken could have been brilliant. A homage to Last Samurai or Laurence of Arabia. And somehow turned out to be *meh*.The movie seems oddly out of pace. Chases are slow, the character development superficially fast. The pivotal scenes are all unconvincing, the design (don't get me started about the teenage space Vespa riders who arguably perform one of the worst car chase scenes in movie history) is off.The main character who is supposed to be one of the most bad-ass headhunters in the Galaxy and a local crime lord needs the help of two armed pigs and some rockabilly bodyguards to deal with a Wookie. He habitually looses his fights. Boba Fett in this series comes across as - well - an old, clueless and rather dull guy. His opposition, the Hutts, come - and then they go and give him the Rancor he was missing in his otherwise completely empty hideout in which he sits alone on a throne or lies in his Bacta tank.

SPOILERS
The while Tuskan plot was stretched over a way too long period of time to ultimately culminate in nothing - The Tuskans are dead and that's it. It's a very long story about how Boba received his war stick (there're way better and quicker ways to obtain one of these)The whole setting was forced into a samurai cowboy western (which Star Wars has never been, at least not to me):The Tuskans were portrayed as native Tattoinian tribes, afraid or uncomprehending technology, except rifles. And ofc there's a train for some reason. That's too much western right there already. Star Wars isn't supposed to be earth's copy pasted history onto another planet. That's too much (prejudice) western right there.All of the story does not explain how Boba devolved from a feared, highly skilled bounty hunter to a naive, overcaring, almost anti violence grandpa incapable of defending himself.Most of this show Boba Fett behaves like a passive Player Character of a game, running around and accepting illlogical quests while completely forgetting all of his decades of experience and skills.Many episodes do a poor job of portraying the Jedi (imo). They are way too over-mystified, unemotional codex-machines.Most episodes really felt like filler episodes, sadlyThe show is carried by Mando who also seems weirdly hollow.The biker kids are a stark contrast to the whole setting: They don't look like they belong (for style and logical reasons) in the setting, or the planet at all. Their augmentations are plainly weird, like those characters walked straight out of cyberpunk into Star Wars.The whole show gave me no Star Wars vibes, sadly. It felt hollow to me. The highlight of all of it was Mando's first appearance, that's sadly it.I'd wished for less forced western and more Star Wars, with no abused and misunderstood native people (Tuskans) and an actual capable, cunning and highly skilled Boba.(Why did Mando drop the saber several times without picking it up again across the last few episodes?)",7,9,/user/ur64332854/?ref_=tt_urv

tt13668894,ur123344330,6,12 February 2022,"I really loved the Mandalorian, it felt like Star Wars done right (Like Rogue 1) to me and emotionally impactful, but this series struggles to maintain my attention even. I hate to say but they should have recast the lead role in this and Mandalorian to a different actor. The reality is that despite the nostalgia, he is too old and chubby to convince in the role anymore and his teeth are really distracting. The script and story are also entirely forgettable for the most part which definitely doesn't help, it's almost like Disney has a schedule to keep to and small, inconsequential things like the quality of the script and story are seen as secondary to nostalgia and fan service.Because of the age of the actor, I feel like the action was dialled down perhaps a bit too much and the character seems to not behave like Boba Fett did. I can also see why people say it's woke.I don't mind that the Rancor was shown to be peaceful as it seemed believable and a good plot twist. I don't really mind that there's a freaking ninja in it doing actual martial arts. However Slave-1 is the name of Boba Fett's ship. It always has been, and Star Wars has been open about slavery in past films, so when they renamed it 'Firestorm', I didn't know what they were even talking about to begin with. I really despise this pointless, virtue signalling revisionism.Making the Tuscan Raiders good, misunderstood if slightly thick tribesmen also doesn't gel with the rest of the Star Wars universe in the slightest and doesn't add anything to the story other than adding a single sad scene when they all get massacred...againMaking Boba Fett's character all nice, cuddly and heroic also deviates from the source material too much and turns him into something completely different and far less interesting than he was when we knew next to nothing about him. Perhaps it's because he would be too similar to the Mandalorian otherwise, but watching Temeura without the helmet on you can easily forget that it's about Boba Fett or that he has Mandalorian armour, a jet pack or any of the other weapons. Boba is never an intimidating killer in this version, he's almost a peace keeper, and doesn't have the discipline, ruthlessness or physical prowess that you would expect from a galaxy-famous feared bounty hunter.The power ranger kids on their Kitchenaid coloured scooters really took me out of the Star Wars universe personally and the effects on the chase sequence in episode 3 looked really ""off"" to me. Strongly dislike. I wasn't a fan of the main bad guys either. They had faces which reminded me a bit of the Ultrons in Avengers universe crossed with the trade federation, seemingly purposely designed to be as bland as possible and devoid of personality.When Mando shows up and Grogu and even ROTJ Luke again, it gets 100% better. The effects work on Luke is absolutely stunningly good to the point that you can't tell in all but a couple of scenes that it's not actually a young Mark Hamill apart from the dialogue sounding a bit disconnected. This really did reveal how deathly dull the series is upto that point, without a clear identity for Boba Fett.So why not just release a season 3 of Mandalorian Disney? Is it so that we have to watch the Boba Fett series as well to get the whole story arc perhaps? I'd avoid the episodes that didn't have Mando in it if I watch this again.

How are you supposed to be a local crime lord when your entire entourage consists of a single side kick and two Gamorrean guards? The later addition of what looks like a bunch of anime castoffs riding very slow floating Vespas doesn't do much to improve things.The saving grace for this series came in the form of the Mandalorian who appears to have taken over as the main character. Really they should have made this as the third Mandalorian series with Boba Fett being a side story because so far there hasn't been enough substance to justify a series dedicated to the character.Overall it is enjoyable and it introduces some very interesting characters and situations that look like they could have a big impact in future Star Wars universe series.

tt13668894,ur144087842,10,23 January 2022,"I've seen many negative reviews about the book of Boba Fett. I can't imagine being a really loyal fan to a franchise while constantly being negative about all films attempting to pay homage. Something doesn't make sense in my little head. As a fan, I admit that I'm disappointed that there's such a divide among the fan base. Is this a genuine schism, or just posers pretending to be fans in order to gain subscribers and viewership? I had voiced an opinion years ago about the Kathleen Kennedy posse and their handling of the beloved franchise. And as it turns out, I was right. It hasn't been very popular. In fact, there has been so much backlash apart from betraying the trust George Lucas bestowed on her to look after the franchise. Even with Kathleen Kennedy's identity politics and polarization of Star Wars primarily promoting characters based on ethnicity and new profound genders, which serve no purpose in the story or help it in any way propel the franchise forward, not to mention the original characters that we have grown to love are either written off-script or killed permanently. Yet a growing number of loyal true fans are demanding retribution. That is why I am thankful to Favro and Filoni, who grew up in the SW universe and understand what needs to be done, particularly how to handle any future spin-offs gracefully.In a recent debate with a fake Star Wars fan on YouTube, I must say this is why the world is screwed today, especially when you're talking to a confused 21-year-old hating streamer with a false sense of comprehension. Frankly, it's alarming because he can't tell the difference between having an objective opinion based on personal experience and making criticism of something purely based on preferences and taste. As such, we're entitled to our opinion. True by remembering we're only consumers and not trying to be some freaken academy award-winning film guru wannbe trying to dissect the entirety of a show. Let me be clear: it is OK to have criticism within the parameters of what you can relate to based on your personal experiences. But please don't pretend to be a certified film critic, especially if you're a noob who hasn't worked in the industry. There's a big difference. Please learn it. That being said, I personally don't get why so many streamers follow the same formula. Is it because they need new content for their followers? How old are these viewers, a.k.a. Followers? The majority of these streamers looked like they were still in puberty.Please allow the working film professionals to tell the story the way they want. I am sure we all have our individual preferences on how to tell this story, but it's not our decision. Personally, when I don't like a film, it's usually because it's boring, too slow, or I have a huge disconnect with the genre. And I have done many personal productions or been involved in other PBS productions, yet I still wouldn't go as far as to say that the professionals are amateurs in comparison like these young streamers have stated. One in particular said during the Book of Boba Fett review that the editing was terrible and that there was no balance. Of what exactly? I swear these youngsters sure know how to piss on people. No one I know watches the series, thinking of a balance, because they're intrigued. Also, a good majority of genuine fans find the pacing of the series pleasant, especially in Episode 2: when the Tuscan storyline is brought to the forefront. True fans are thankful, grateful for the justice done to the franchise. Rather, then bashing the mechanical process and development involved in the making and not the bulk of the overall Story itself which I must admit an odd reaction for a so call real fan.It feels like people are on this troll bandwagon just looking for something to undermine. Majority of the time is sounds like they're talking out of their asses and the approach would have been easier to digest if they kept it a criticism, but instead went off the rails by trying to be something else. If only for a moment try to understand that you're not a fan but a troll with too much time on your hand. You can't be a fan of something and be negative about it all the time. Take a moment and confront your reason and real motives. Think on that for a second. I am totally challenging the common sense of that statement. How are you a fan if you find nothing in the series entertaining? As if your purpose in life is to live only to hate the series? It's simple don't watch it!

I was waiting to write a review until after the show was over so I got a clear view of the story in its entirety. I can now say that it was average. In my opinion it does not have the rewatch appeal like the Mandalorean or the original Star Wars movies do. So what was the problem with this show? To be honest it was the titular character, Boba Fett.I grew up watching Star Wars and my favorite was the 5th and the 6th. A huge reason for that was Boba Fett. He was cool, mysterious, and knew how to fight leading to interesting scenes with him. He joined Vador as a ruthless villian in those movies because he really didn't care what happened to anyone and was just in it for the money, leading to the development of a great bad guy.SPOILERS FOR THE MANDALOREAN:
When he appeared in the Mandalorean he was just as cool as he was before, taking down squadron after squadron of troopers and doing it ruthlesslyNow though he just... doesn't fight. He rarely wins a fight in this show, everybody else fights for him, and he lost his ruthlessness until the last episode. If they had the Boba Fett of the finale in every episode the show would have been cool. I appreciate the direction they were trying to take with his character, but you can still have a kind character that cares about other people while keeping a bit of ruthlessness attached. The Mandalorean is proof of that. The way they made Boba Fett in this show just felt kind of boring.This is not the only problem with the show. The dialog isn't great (especially in the last episode) and the directing is questionable in some of the episodes. I also thought there were some weak points in the acting all around. The story was pretty good and well thought out though the constant flashbacks do get a bit tedious.Overall the show was fun to watch, especially the 5th and 6th episodes and I think it's worth a watch but did I love it and will I rewatch it again?

Boba somehow is the Daimyo couse he killed Bib Fortuna and thinking like ""yeah now everybody will accept me even i doing nothing and i have no workers/fighters who defend/rides Tatoonie. Now Boba is walking through the desert slowly and walking through the citys slowly and talking like a cretin without respect.And of course no one fears his name even he was the number one Bounty hunter in the galaxy. I guess the writers didn saw the Empire strikes back and only watched the Jedi return ""Boba Fett!? Where!?"" Scene.He just not woring his helmet he is easily giving away for wahing like WTF!? Dude! You are not the Boba who was in the Mandalorian season 2. That Boba would never give this easily away his fathers legacy JUST NO!My god the writers handed so good and respectful Boba in the Mandalorian why they cant here what happened? And what is that stupid ""I want to lead with respect not with fear..."" but he killed before Bib Fortuna without hesitation okay i guess the writers of this show forgot that (or didnt see it just like TESB).And at last a very lame fight scene... Boba and Fennec are surrounded by shilded assassins aaand. Boba is not using his jetpack. *FacepalmChapter 2 was good thx to ""Arabian Lawrence script"" and.And again the past was good with the tuskens and finally the present started to go in an interesting way! The Hutts! Oh wow this show is gonna be good! Me naive...Chapter 3 The Tusken part was still good the end of them was beautiful. But finally not the past was focused aaaand...
oh my that was the part when the show confirmed the fact that the writers had no idea what to do with the ""present time"".Cyberpunk thief ganks crying about the water is too expensive but they had money for tip-top bikes and expensive cyborg eye and parts (They talking trash and this ""characters"" are so not fitting of the citys of Tatooine).And Boba giving this thugs job and threaten the one who wanted his help (the water seller) great work to protect the folks of Tatooine.Back in the palace the place still not guarded but how could it be couse there is max 10 guard in that big palace so a big Wookie easily can attack the backta meme Boba and a terrible choreographed fight scene which was prety weak and lame (Boba without his armor is useless thx writers, producers and directors for this show and shame).After that The hutts who should be interesting saying bye bye couse the writers couldnt do with us anything but here here a Rancor which is not a trap (and thats true... :D ).A little petting with the Rancor and we can guess that Boba will ride it like a Bantha in the final.Then theres the famously bad chasing scene with the power cyber punk ranger bikers and Boba still do nothing but finally once he used his jatpack but obviously after the chase ended couse logic (and oh god why is there that pathetic Comic relief twilek in the show WHY!?...)Chapter 4 But again the past in the focus and they trully want to sell us that Boba spended 5 years with the Tuskens?It felt like max 1-2 years. But alright. Most likely Boba sat in the desert for 3 years to wait when the guards magically dissaper from the gate.Its more believable... And here comes the Fennec rescue... Oh god we need to watch these cyber punk imbiciles again.After that they are talking, a Bantha petting/licking scene and yada yada Fennec doing the works while Boba chasing
a little droid... So funny ha ha the most fearfull bounty hunter my *** (Heres the terrible and why dialog to the droid ""You know who i am im Boba Fett!"").Interestingly when he was at the tuskens he didnt cared about the armor and the ship or he is the son of Jango Fett but now yes, couse reasons and he release this ""feelings"" for a little froid (Strong and faithful character writing).Revenge with the Slave 1 sry ""Firespray"" on the dog bikers and then the Sarlaac Pit scene.My god... Boba forgot about that he escaped with the armor and like an idiot flying in front of the mouth of the Sarlaac. *Facepalm.And the funniest thing Fennec saved Boba again by killing the monster with the sesmic bomb (yeah dont give the revenge for Boba but dont worry they stoled even mor from him in his OWN SHOW).The laughable scene with ""dont touch my ship"" but we dont laugh couse it was fun but because it was terrible and stupid.Chapter 5 and 6 we dont talk about this two episode couse these are added from the Mandalorian Season 3
Idk what happened at the producer room but its like they weekly did this episodes and they like
""oh sh** we have no idea what to do with Boba Fett but in our head its sounded good but we dont want to spend money on the writers what we should do!?"" ""Add the first episodes of the Mandalorian S3 episodes no one will cares they looks like the same.""
Anyway 0 Boba, Mando know better Tatooine couse he is the one who doing anything (recruit soldiers).While Boba just standing and say nothing (he should drool would be more fitting to the scene).Oh and here comes Cad Bane BUT my thoughts was ""Oh my finally! But only one episode left so they gonna rush it or not deal with it enough.""
This series could tell their stories (Bane and Bobas story and they could add the unfinished
clone wars episodes as flashbacks... Or something like that) but no... There is no true Boba Fett just that ""walking and talking nonsense things Fett"").Chapter 7 Rushed. Boba doing nothing, akward timing and jokes (especially with that terrible twilek character).Some talk between Cad and Boba (but it was not enough). Boba had no plan at all. The cyber punk girl talking trash again and Boba just follow her ""order"" to where to hide.Baby Yoda is back to steal the show (what am i saying it was stolen from Boba almost from the beginning.)
That time stoling twilek fun fun ha ha scene. Finally the battle (unfurtunatelly the cyber punk gank not died...) The akward but someway cool Rancor scenes. And the Mandalorian with Grogu again stealing the showtime from Boba.But finally a fight and a little chat again between the two famous bounty hunter! And ended shortly... Aaaand they killed Cad Bane just like that. Thx for wasting this character too. Grogu calms down the rancor not accidentally would Boba nah!Finally a brutal bounty hunter/assassin scene when all the bad guys brutally murdered and im telling wow finally thats the Boba Fett who im waited BUT IT IS FENNEC! AHHAHAHA *Facepalm Yes again they taken nearly all the credits from Boba.And the funny thing the episode closing with not Boba but with Djin Djarin and Grogu! (Then there is an end credit scene but we try to forgot it).And thats it that was the Book of Boba Fett without the Book and without the true Boba Fett character.

1. They successfully conveyed the message they were trying to develop, it simply wasn't captivating enough, which is very frustrating.2. Robert Rodriguez single handedly downgraded this show. His three episodes were, in my opinion, the weakest, especially regarding the story.3. Reuniting Din and Grogu after almost no time was a huge mistake. They must have a really good reason bringing them back together already.4. If Mandalorian Season 3 has anything close to filler, they made a big mistake include episodes 5 and 6 in the show, even though episode 6 is some of the best Star Wars ever.5. Cad Bane should've been introduced as the antagonist earlier, especially if they're gonna presumable kill him in the finale.6. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT
There needs to be more people in the writer's room, Favreau's writing was not the same this show. Maybe he didn't get to tell the story in his mind because of something BTS, literally the only explanation I can think of. There weren't bad ideas, but it seemed like a lot was left up to the directors, resulting in inconsistency. The mod biker gang was actually his idea, not Robert Rodriguez AKA Mr Spy Kids. Lots of unnecessary exposition, lazy explanations, and missing connections. What happened to all the emphasis on water? Kamino flashbacks, and constantly mentioning Tatooine had oceans in all the beginning episodes, should've amounted to something? Or did he just need to fill time with random facts? Fennec was originally sidelined heavy; most of her dialogue was meant for Boba but Temuera noticed this, and gave her most of his lines. If that didn't happen, she would barely be in the show. Also, Bane and Fennec have an established history that was shown just seven months ago on screen, so why completely ignore that?As someone who wasn't hooked on the show when it was announced, it was good overall, but felt like a strange story choice/focus.

So where to start?For starters, this show tries to make Boba to something else his true nature just isn't: Boba finds his true meaning and becomes a likable dude in the neighborhood, right? The true psychopath changes his ways and start giving for the people?Not likely. I was hoping for a story of a man who is likable for his disqualities. This has been done before; Michael Corleone, Tony Stark, Anton Chigurh, Hannibal Lecter etc.Another disturbing thing is, as mentioned before, Bobas inability to handle the action; he lets others do the job. Not even close to the bad ass character he is supposed to be.And the scooters... Don't get me even started...After seeing the third of the latest episode, the episode 5, I was pleasantly reminded how I felt with The Mandalorian, told my wife how ingenious Jon Favreau must be to pull this story off, how the geekines of his is sooo cool, him knowing so much of the SW -universe, not a flaw in sight!And now this.Not a stormtrooper in sight on the planet. No Imperial presence what so ever. Err... What?And how ever ""good and kind"" Boba's got, he makes a total massacre of the bikers, totally going against of the psychology of his in he story before, the way he is supposedly portrayed, his insights, in the beginning.

A character who obviously feel nothing, who is supposed to be bad ass, but don't/can't deliver anything but... yeah, said it already: ""Knowing bad as cringe"" all the effing time. Nothing one could feel for or identify one self with.Mando was a new character with no past for us before. He probably was an easier character to write on for that very same reason.

Creating jarring moments of confusion that does not seem to connect with the events of previous episodes there is little to no build-up. And some events feel more like a check list where its more about world building than telling a story. And the story suffers from it.And Boba fett appear like a very unrealistic character with little to nothing of his background as a bounty hunter showing trough. Nor does his experience as a person of the criminal underworld seem to know much of it. Doing weird acts of kindness that does not suit the setting or character in the world that is being presented.Maybe this is the PG rating limiting their ability to execute but i would say that as long as this show tries to be to child friendly it will suffer from it exponentially. . .,unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur126467447/?ref_=tt_urv

The series picked up pace after the arrival of Mando but the beginning part of the series was SLOW, BORING AND STRAIGHT OUT BAD to a certain extent.The series HAD TO forcefully enter beloved characters from other Star Wars franchises to make it stand on its feet, OTHERWISE...The standout performance of the series was by far Ming Na-Wen (Fennec Shand). She was badass, deadly and ruthless yet faithful, honorable and beautiful...She is the Black Widow of Star Wars. Black Krrsantan should have been developed more. He is an absolute BEAST, but here, he seemed very vulnerable and somewhat tame. Cad Bane should have gotten WAYYY more screen time and episodes. He alone could have made the series shine. The Mod Gang angle was AWFUL and poorly executed.The series also lacked a central villain, the addition of which would have made for more compelling storytelling.On a final note, when you have to forcefully enter beloved and established characters from other franchises to make a series stand, it's NEVER a good sign. A Boba Fett series WITHOUT much contribution from him (apart from the finale) is unacceptable.

tt13668894,ur142616709,7,10 February 2022,"Having a TV-series focusing on the continuing story of Boba Fett looked promising. Afterall, Fett is one of the most iconic and beloved Star Wars characters of all time. Unfortunately the final product felt disoriented, unfocused and overly chaotic. I felt that there was just too much cramped into this seven episode-series. What the writers were trying to achieve here felt very unclear in the end.The first couple of episodes focuses on Boba getting things in order after taking over Jabba's Palace. We also get lengthy flashbacks showcasing Boba's life on Tatooine before the events of the Mandalorian. We see things like how he escaped from the Sarlacc Pit, how he befriends a group of Tusken Raiders and how he first came in contact with Fennec Shand. This provided a different take on the bounty hunter who develops into a more respectable ""man of the people"".The flashbacks had a few hiccups here and there, but I mostly enjoyed them. The rest however was pretty dull. Even through the second and third episode I found the show did a poor job of setting up what the conflict was about and who the enemy was supposed to be.The fifth and sixth episodes were the best. They were incredible even. This was when Mando and Grogu returned and stepped into the picture. By the fifth episode, it essentially felt like the show stopped being about Boba Fett and instead became the Mandalorian season 2.5. It kind of says a lot when the absolute peak of this Boba Fett-show is not even about, or hardly features Boba Fett. This is something I found quite dissapointing, no matter how much I liked these two episodes.In the final seventh episode we see Fett, Mando with allies fighting the Pyke Syndicate for control of Mos Espa. This could have been a great finale, but it too felt underwhelming. It's chaotic, poorly structured, and just feels rushed. The end of the sixth episode teased that Cad Bane was going to play a big part in the battle but instead almost all of it revolves around Fett and Mando fighting two droids. Bane do show up at the very end, but he gets killed off in like two minutes. We don't even get a satisfying confrontation between Boba and the syndicate. We only get a short, out-of-place sequence of Fennec Shand randomly assassinating the leader and that's it. The finale would have been a lot better if it focused more on the important elements of the story. That battle against those droids could have been cut in half for all I care.In summary, it's still a good show, I did enjoy most of it. I only feel like it needed a lot more time in the oven because it feels like it wasn't properly planned out. I'm also not too sure about the decision to make Boba-Fett a ""good guy"". It just didn't feel right to me. His mysterious, cold, and unsympathetic persona is what made fans fell in love with the character in the first place, and this show shy away from that too much.With all this said, I will give the show a 7/10. I could easily drop it down to a 6 but I will keep it at a 7 because of the two episodes revolving Mando and Grogu.I also want to mention the those ""modders"" and their ridiculous scooters. I don't know who designed them, but Disney seriously needs to have that person fired.

A walking, talking, flying, shooting Easter egg. ""Wow, that was young boba fett watching his father die at the hands of a Jedi."" Maybe that would have been the better story. Watching a young boba climb the ranks of the mandalore to break out on his own. This installment of boba's story is gangs of New York, and cliche fan service. It's rare that the main character is as useless as bobba. Everyone around him shines as he broods not so impressively. But then again bobba always was a side character.

tt13668894,ur144580325,3,23 January 2022,"The show's been a disaster. Every fight scene is so poorly done it's actually embarrassing.Boba in ep 1 while fighting the orange shield dudes (Who are legendary Assassins. What a joke) all circle Boba, & instead of using his Jetpack to fly away, or his Flame thrower to set the guys legs on fire, or just pull out a blaster that he has on his belt, Boba decides to shoot a missile at a person 3 feet in front of him,& putting everything into account, the shrapnel alone probably should have killed him, the pushback from the explosion should've given him major Whiplash, & hurt his body, & finally the heat from the explosion should've burned his face off, but he's fine, he just gets knocked off his feet, & gets back up 10 seconds later like the explosion is just a big gust of wind, & nothing lethal, then the gamorrean guards show up to ""Save the day."" but that's only because the orange shield dudes shut off their shields for no reason & give Fennec a opening to hit them for who knows why, which by the way the Gamorean guards right before the fight teleport out of existence right before the fight starts.I'm not joking, they literally teleport right before the fight starts, literally check the scene again, you can't make this up. They are right behind Boba, & Fennec 15 seconds before the fight starts, but disappear right before the first guy jumps off the roof, only because the writers wanted to give them a ""here to the rescue"" moment in the ""When all hope is lost"" moment, despite it literally making no sense on why they weren't there to begin with, & weren't there for the first 2 minutes of the fight.Can we talk about how all the enemies have only melee weapons! If a single one of them just had a blaster, the fight would gone a whole lot smoother. Like when they walk out of the bar, they both aren't wearing helmets, so if they pulled out a sniper on a roof of the building, & shot both of them in the head, it'd be game over. Just like that.Onto another thing, why is Boba & Fennec not wearing their helmets in the fight? Like I get they're carrying money, but can't they literally just get like a grocery bag to put their shiny coins, & not their armor that's meant to protect him. Jeez for 2 legendary bounty Hunters, they're incredibly stupid.How about once Fennec & Boba drop their helmets (Which happened because Boba decided to shoot a missile 3 feet in front of him by the way) it sure is lucky a single Jawa didn't just grab the helmet and leave, but they all individually try to pick the coins up out of the helmet, instead of just taking the thing & leaving. That Beskar Helmet is worth more than all those coins in it. I assure you.All those people in that fight are legendary Bounty Hunters, or legendary Assassins, but all of them act like they've never used a single one of their weapons in their life. We know that these bounty Hunters had the intent to kill them as it's confirmed later, which makes it so much more embarrassing because you can't argue they wanted him alive. The guys were just really stupid.Not to mention I've only been talking about a single 4 minute fight scene out of many of the terrible fights in this show. Don't even get me started the embarrassing assassination attempt where that Wookiee literally failed to make one of the easiest kills ever. You know what screw it., let's talk about it.The legendary Wookiee assassin failed to kill a sleeping man in an empty room all alone with no one keeping watch. How do you screw that up? That's like a job a rookie assassin would get as their first run to get into becoming a better assassin. How dumb are you black coated wookiee to screw up one of the easiest kills ever?!How am I supposed to take you as a serious threat, when you're so bad at your job. I could've done a better job then that dumb Wookiee. The guy literally forgot to bring a gun, & just put a hole in his head, or a knife to the temple, or strangle him with his bare hands, but the Wookiee decides to grab him, & throw him over to Bobas weaponry? Why in the world out of that huge empty room the Wookie decides to grab him & throw him over to his weaponry?Does the Wookiee want a challenge or something? Like if I was going to be good faith does the Wookiee want to see how much he go up against Boba, because I know the Wookiee has a relationship in the extended lore, & apparently it used to be a bit fighter to an extent, so is the Wookiee just trying to have fun while beating him up? Okay then but the Wookiee doesn't even bring a gun for backup? Like does the Wookiee know there is other people in the building, & making all this Ruckus is going to cause like so much nose that's going to alert everyone to him. Does the Wookiee not even want to bring a backup weapon like a single blaster just in case of emergency? What was going through this Wookiees mind it's so freaking g baffling. This might be one of the most pathetic assassination attempts I've seen in media ever.What if the the Wookiee just turned off the power to the Bacta tank, & block the oxygen, having Boba drown, then hold the tank closed as Boba struggles to escape. Heck that might've been really smart thing to do, & it would be real sneaky, & not much nose, & the Wookiee could leave before everyone even figures out he's dead, & heck the Wookiee could even make it look like an accident, so when Fennec finds him dead she'll think it's a unrelated death that had nothing to do with the Hutts & they'd be in the clear.....but no.. ..this show isn't smart enough to do things like that..So the Mod dudes show up, & the fight choreography is again super stupid. One of the guys has a gun, & shoots the Wookiee 3 times in the one plate of armor he has on, that's covering about 5% of his body at most. Then he closes the distance, & gets hit by the Wookiee. YOU HAVE A GUN!! WHY ARE YOU GETTING CLOSER TO HIM!! YOU FREAKING IDIOTS!!Then the Gamorrean guard duo show up again like they just teleport out of existence again just right when the show runners need them to. The Gamorrean guards have been working for people in this palace for a very long time. Bib Fortuna for 5 years before Boba, & who knows how many years when Jabba was here. (This is confirmed in the very first episode when you meet the Gamorrean guards by the way) so these 2 should know the layout better than the Mod squad should, but they show up first despite never even visiting this palace until a couple hours ago. WHAT THE HELL!?!?Then the Wookiee tackles them down a very small flight of stairs, & the Mod Squad just stop fighting for 25 seconds despite all still standing there when the Wookiee tackles them, they even can be seen just watching the Wookiee tackle the guards too in the background,& then the Wookiee is just fighting those 2 for 25 seconds while the Mod Squad is upstairs doing nothing. HELP THEM!! Why are you not doing anything. Why are you letting these guys fight the Wookiee on their own. Then just out of pure coincidence, the Wookiee was standing on the small 3 foot wide gap in a huge open room. BOI THAT WAS LUCKY!!Then Fennec decides to grab her gun, pull the knife out of her gun, & throw it at the Wookiee. WHY?!? Just shoot him, don't waste your knife that's designed specifically for being put into your gun. You use that for certain situations that's not this one. Does she know that she can even get that knife back? What if she never finds it down there. She lost a special knife designed to go inside her gun, when he could have just shot him. Now because Fennec threw that knife the Wookiee has more weapons now then he did when he came to commit this assassination attempt. How embarrassing is that to think about? All because threw that knife at him. Now later when they have to go down the door, & put the Wookiee is cuffs, they're at a risk of that Wookiee using that Knife against them. Great job for throwing that knife at him. Real smart move, also can we talk about later when they bring the Wookiee outside to confront the Hutts (That are just totally okay arriving at their front door for some reason.) & let him go. The Wookiee still has his Knuckle Dusters on while cuffed. WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING HIM TO JUST WEAR THOSE!? ARE YOU TRYING TO GET HURT ALLOWING THE MAN WHO YESTERDAY ATTEMPTED TO KILL YOU KEEP WEAPONRY AS YOUR PRISONER?!?..also can we talk about how Disney made a show about Boba Fett, & there isn't a single drop of blood?Like whos decision was it to make that an option to never show blood? Disney censoring all the carnage from the kills makes some part s of the show feel laughable when something violent is happening.The Wookiee rips a mans arm out of their sockets in episode 4 & there is not a single drop of blood, it's hilarious.How about back to the first fight in episode 1 with the red shield dudes, Boba shoots another rocket at a guy climbing up a wall, & he gets a bullseye on him, & the guy just disappears, like no blood goes anywhere. No limbs fly anywhere. He just disappears once the missile hits him, & it's so goofy.Can we talk about how Boba watches the Wookiee assault a bunch of innocent men, & he's just like ""Hey want a job."" Like doesn't Boba not care about the poor guy that just mailed by him? Like throughout this show Boba has shown to care about a bunch of innocent peoples well being, but doesn't bat an eye at that moment in episode 4. It doesn't feel right.Also small thing that's kinda just a nitpick, but I thought it would be funny to bring up anyways. Bobas nose isn't blocked off when he's in the bacta tank. People often breath through their nose when sleeping, so the fact that doesn't have anything to block off the tubes of his nose when sleeping in the tank is really odd.This show is garbage. Anyone who thinks this was actually good, you just have low standards, & you're not someone I would ever trust to recommend media for me to watch.",11,15,/user/ur144580325/?ref_=tt_urv

However the rest I would give between a 3-6/10.The reason being is it just didn't feel like Boba Fett, let alone a Boba Fett show. Boba Fett is a ruthless bounty hunter who is widely known and renowned across the galaxy. He's someone who incinerated Luke's family on Tatooine back in A New Hope and someone who Vader had to calm down in many situations do to his urgency to act and use overwhelming force in sometimes unnecessary situations. This is all part of his character. Whether it be from the dialogue in Empire where Vader tells Boba ""no disintegrations"" or when Boba is about to shoot Chewbacca on Cloud City and Vader has to stop him. We can even look to Return of the Jedi on the sale barge when Boba flies off to fight a Jedi, which he didn't even have to do. Furthermore we can look back at his development in The Clone Wars TV show and how he single handedly takes down a Venator class star destroyer and almost kills Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker.Instead what we got in the show was a Boba Fett that was too old, fat, and dumb. Someone too slow to act and someone who didn't even seem to understand the things necessary to lead.I applaud Temuera Morrison for being on the show and doing the best with what he was given, because we know he is perfectly capable of playing an intimidating gunslinger of a bounty hunter (Jango Fett) as seen in Episode II Attack of the Clones. But sadly that is not what we got.Furthermore, the show would have served better to build up Cad Bane as the ""Big Bad"" of the show instead of introducing him in the 2nd to last episode leaving us to believe there is some huge rivalry between them. (Which if they actually made the unfinished Clone Wars episodes we'd understand that rivalry).Anyways going back to Episodes 5 and 6 which were basically Mandalorian season 2.5. While the episodes themselves were amazing, they should have waited to do them in Season 3 of the Mandalorian and not made Grogu come back to Mando so quickly. It completely ruins what was set up in the first 2 Mandalorian seasons and just doesn't feel right. So many important things happened for Mando in a show that wasn't even his own.But to conclude this review, I really wish Jon Favreau put more care into writing this season and I wish they had a better director direct the finale. The show was full of plot holes and characters that were either weird or not themselves. I understand characters change but Boba's character change did not seem realistic for the time period between when we last saw him along with how he acted in The Mandalorian Season 2.It would've been so easy to make this show so much better...Anyways if you enjoyed this show that is your opinion and if you didn't, the same goes.

With that said, I honestly had really low expectations, and was expecting to be really disappointed and wouldn't watch more than the first episode, but I ended up being completely wrong.. It was actually entertaining, and would look forward to the following week for the release of the next episode. Then came the season finale..... As the entire season so far was a bit above average, (not amazing) I was expecting the season finale to continue the trend, but man was I wrong... It needs to be said, whoever the director was for the season finale, they should get fired Immediately, this finale literally ruined the entire show. The effects were mediocre, which was expected and is not the reason why the finale ruined the show.. the carelessness of how they didn't even think about some reality and logical movement and progression of the characters movements and surroundings. SPOILERS
EX: the scene before the final scene, somehow the enemy got shot through the wall of a building, without rubble coming down, the ceiling had a sunlight, but with not proportioned where the shots where coming from.. somehow another enemy got lassoed and hung by the neck and pulled up through the ceiling? The wire also somehow magically went through the ceiling, and pulled up the enemy through the ceiling..
Another, was went mandalorian, jumped on top of the enemy walking turret, with the black saber, and for some reason just stood on top for 10 seconds which allowed it to shoot boba Fetts pet monster, which is completely stupid. He would have immediately used the saber the moment he got on top, within the same scene, mandalorian used the saber to cut off one of the big turret guns the walking robot had, which the next step a real mandalorian would do is cut the second gun to disable the entire robot, but for some reason he cut into the head of the robot, which also didn't destroy or disable the robot..
There is so much more I can say, but the main point is that this episode was awful and honestly I as an amateur, if given the opportunity remake the finale with all the same resources, I could have made it 100 times better than what Disney released.

tt13668894,ur27650770,3,10 February 2022,"I loved The Mandalorian as much as anyone else - but this is just a horrible mess of a show. I'm usually not that picky when it comes to story, pacing and such. Sci-fi is sci-fi and acition is action. I swallow most stuff cuase I'm a casual viewer.But how this badly written, badly acted, badly edited mess is made by the same people who made The Mandalorian - and with all that money they must have been allocated - that is a mystery.My biggest gripes are:
It takes us half the series to get to know WHY a caracter like Fett is even doing what he's doing. Having surprises is one thing. Just sitting there for four-five episodes and wonder WHY is Boba Fett - the bounty hunter that worked for Darth Vader - suddenly settleing down as some kind of good willing crime lord?The multiple timelines are not confusing like in Westworld S02 - but they make you feel like those epsides are just two shows cut together. One rather OK story with the Raiders - and one abysmal made in the style of the Power Ranger series. They clash so hard in style and execution.The Tusken Raider part of Episode 2 is a Steven Seagal short movie but with Boba Fett. He hangs with the natives like Steven. He rides around and looks att stuff like Steven. He fights like Steven. And he masters the natives fighitng style, wins their hearts and becomes a hero to them as he saves their asses - just like Steven.Seriously - just visualize Steven Segal instead of Boba Fett in all those scenes... He's a perfect fit.The Modders are the Jar-Jar Binks of this series. Akward and annoying. They even have their own music - so those scenes rips you right out of Star Wars, and into some kind of Cyberpunk 2077 / Fifth Element mashup. With a touch of Power Rangers.The fights, especially the early ones, are just horribly written. The one were Boba and Fennec fights the Foot Clan in episode one (weirldy aided by Beebop and Rocksteady...) is so akwardly cut.. It gets better but as I said before - the Power Rangers feeling is there,Luke is peak uncanny valley. Never really felt it before (except for the end of Mando) but this is just weird when he's on screen for so long And.. Was he as annoying as he is here in the old movies? He kind of was really - just that he was overshadowed by poor Anakin. He sounds like he's reading his lines of signs behind the camera. Old Luke played by old Mark Hamill in the newer movies was a nice, worthy representation. Grogu-training Luke is just so meek you wonder if he'd even win an argument with a phone salesman.And now - when the series have ended, he's sitting there with his little stone igloo Jedi school - and no Jedi? A stone igloo Jedi school he had built by a bunch of slow stone picking robots instead of building himself with his Jedi forces? Ooookay.The scene were he runs around with Grogu in a back pack is, just like Rambo (4) is a serious version of Hot Shots 2, a serious version of the same cut Bad Lip Reading did in that Yoda song with the stick. It even fits with the lyrics from the ""I can be your backpack while you run"" line.There is more. But it feels bad to piss on it - since it's probably made out of love. But I just can't understand how this is such a train wreck when Mando was so GOOD?Some epsides are worth more than a 3 for sure - but given the track record and budget, and writers - this has some high standards to meet. It's like if Lewis Hamilton would be a Star In A Reasonably Priced Car on Top Gear - and we found out he couldn't drive a stick.

tt13668894,ur29713455,8,11 February 2022,"As a long-time Star Wars fan I've always held Boba Fett as one of the franchise's most interesting characters, as well as a personal top-league favorite. Years ago when the plans for a Boba Fett movie got scrapped I was bummed out. Years later when the Book of Boba Fett was announced I was more hyped than I had been since ep.3 was released in 2005. That's how much I love Boba Fett.Having watched all of the episodes in this ""book"" I can confidently say that I did enjoy it as a whole. While certainly not without its faults, I do think the show delivered a solid (if somewhat short) story about the legendary bounty hunter. However, the problems at hand are quite hard to ignore. For instance, it's got to be very confusing to watch this if you haven't watched all of the Mandalorian beforehand, as the shows cross one another by essentially becoming the other for two full episodes. Secondly, a few details such as the show's infamous cyberpunk kids are really out of place and truly add nothing to the show. It becomes an eyesore to the classic Star Wars environment, especially on the planet of Tatooine.Another thing I really must point out and quite frankly question is the fans' point of view here. I've seen many complain about Boba's new character - that he's become rather talkative and also takes off his helmet a lot. While I do understand these complaints per se, I do think these character traits fit perfectly with the story they provided for Boba Fett here. What I'm saying is, how could Boba Fett set out to do what he did here without talking and commanding? Especially when he tries to do it in a respecting and peaceful way. It makes full sense to me and Boba's new lifestyle.While most stuff presented in this show is cool for what it is, maybe it wasn't quite the right direction to move Boba Fett in. Not yet anyway. Evidently the fans weren't ready for these changes in Boba Fett's character, and the total merge-swapping with the Mandalorian towards the season's end just made things even stranger.Still, as a long-time die-hard fan of Boba Fett I'm pleased with what was given, only leaving me wanting even more of it. While I would probably say that the Mandalorian is the better show writing-wise, Boba Fett is certainly a more familiar and favorable character (to me). Wherever this show shined it also shined brightly. The climactic battle had me crying a few tears of sheer joy because of how epic it was to witness the old bounty hunter, joined by the almost-as-cool Din Djarin, and just wreak havoc with all the mandalorian gadgets.Ultimately I give this show an 8 outta 10. Admittedly somewhat affected by my personal nostalgia and fandom for the titular character.",0,2,/user/ur29713455/?ref_=tt_urv

Visually it's great, minus the chase scene in ep.3. But almost everything else leaves you wanting more and not in a good way. I want more character development, more plot, and better fight scenes! The only thing it needs less of is main stream actors. Why are they putting so many familiar faces in Star Wars? I'm constantly being pulled out of the fantasy I'm trying to immerse myself into every time they throw another famous person on the screen. Like why does Danny Trejo and Stephen Root need to play these roles when I've seen them in ten other things in the last year.

tt13668894,ur46964391,1,20 January 2022,"The Book of Boba Fett, the once-menacing freelancer has become a softie with a heart of gold. He has relinquished his title as a bounty hunter, become so curiously forgiving that he actually set free a Wookiee assassin just moments after it tried to murder him in his sleep, stroked a rancor behind its ear as if it were his oversized house cat and called a Tusken raider ""mate"".It all started during an episode of The Mandalorian, in which Boba was properly reintroduced to audiences, where he spoke of his fear and disapproval of the Empire - one of his former and frequent clients. Within minutes, he was fighting for the light side for the very first time, having inexplicably been repositioned as a ""good guy"". Or a guy with a moral compass, at least. Whatever he is now, he's unrecognisable from the character that once fascinated Star Wars fans.This is the same Boba who previously had no problem working for notorious choker Darth Vader and notorious chokee Jabba the Hutt. When we were introduced to the live-action version of the character in The Empire Strikes Back (he actually made his first appearance in the animated segment of the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special in 1978), he was quite obviously a cold-blooded gun-for-hire with the sole aim of collecting his next bounty. It may have just been business, but he certainly wasn't petting monsters and making friends. So why the sudden transformation?All we need now is a subplot in which he adopts a baby version of Yoda and spends two episodes wiping sick off its chin
What originally made Boba the most interesting and mysterious character in the franchise was the fact that we knew absolutely nothing about him. Back then, he was just this cool, armoured bloke who stood on the side looking hard. He never took off his helmet and he barely spoke - he had a grand total of four lines in The Empire Strikes Back, and none at all in Return of the Jedi. And yet he still went on to become one of the most popular and talked about characters of the original trilogy. So much so that creator George Lucas even briefly considered making him the main villain in Jedi, with the ambitious intention of stretching out Luke Skywalker's story over a number of subsequent trilogies.Making Boba Fett the main bad guy, or even a central character, would have diminished his all-important mystique, something that ultimately ended up happening anyway when he was dreadfully reintroduced as a child clone in Episode II: Attack of the Clones.And now it's happening all over again. As this Disney+ series continues to examine his softer side in excruciatingly uninteresting detail, it feels as though the circle of bastardisation is almost complete. All we need now is a subplot in which he adopts a baby version of Yoda and spends at least two episodes wiping sick off its chin.Thanks to its treatment of the once badass, nihilistic bounty hunter, The Book of Boba Fett has turned out to be just another piece of bitterly disappointing, franchise-tarnishing tosh.

tt13668894,ur66499693,7,9 February 2022,"I feel that The Book of Boba Fett had a lot to live up to. Unlike its predecessor, The Mandalorian, the titular character had a pre-established identity in the Star Wars universe and the weight of the world's expectations upon his shoulders.The show spent the first four episodes devoted to Boba's character development in the years following his near-death experience in the Sarlacc pit. During this time, there were brief moments in which a 'present day' narrative were introduced. It then sidelined him for two episodes in order to develop other plot points related to The Mandalorian, before returning to hurriedly cap off an almost forgotten narrative in the final episode.But with all that said, I actually quite enjoyed this show. I think the decision to give Boba a 180 character development was interesting - transforming him from a ruthless bounty hunter into a tribe-focused daimyo was just that, interesting. Maybe not what fans of Boba were desperate for, but it was a pivot that made for interesting content.For me, episodes 2, 5, & 6 were stand outs by far and the reason for the title of this review being that these episodes delivered some of the best Star Wars content in a long time.I have to address it, since it's on everyone's s#itlist: the Mod gang. I wanted to like them, I really did! I wanted to give them a chance, despite how everyone came against them and hated on them. But I can't help but agree with a lot of the hate for them. They ended up being an entirely throwaway addition to the show that would have not changed a thing about it regardless of whether they were there or not.Also, in regards to Cad Bane's short cameo on this show. I have mixed feelings. On paper, a showdown between Boba Fett and Cad Bane is what everyone could have ever wanted. However, I can't help but feel that Cad's life was wasted on Boba (in the context of this show with it being so rushed). But on the other hand, Cad dying to Boba in the way that he did really cemented the first four episodes of Boba's new character arc. The fact that Cad was trying to bait out the 'old Boba' in a duel of blasters and Boba took said bait and ended up at the mercy of Cad. Only to turn it around at the last moment with the Gaffi stick - it goes to show that his time spent with the Tuskens really did help him grow, as we just saw, the old Boba could never have beaten Cad in a duel.After finishing the series, I do believe this show was a corporate decision made as a launchpad for The Mandalorian S3 to take off from, rather than having its own original identity.

tt13668894,ur69088717,9,7 January 2022,"This doesn't even come close to the mandalorian. Boring story line. Boba is too old, ugly and a bad actor. Didn't even make it to the end of episode 1.",4,17,/user/ur69088717/?ref_=tt_urv
tt13668894,ur7001024,5,11 February 2022,"Season One of The Book of Boba Fett was... a hot mess. But I'll start with the positives:These new Star Wars shows have insane production values. The budgets have so-far been well North of insane and it shows. There are a lot of fun, good-looking effects, costumes, creatures, set-pieces etc. On display in BoBA. And all that is a sizable chunk of the appeal of Star Wars in general: the weird, the alien, the bits in the background. Tatooine is an especially rich setting in that regard. The show is almost worth a watch just for that aspect.It definitely has good moments and good individual episodes. The fifth episode was, by far, the best of the season and actually one of the very best episodes of The Mandalorian. Which is also... well, it's its own special problem that I'll address a bit further below.And there was great potential in the premise of the show. A Tatooine-set story about different factions grappling for power in the void that formed from Jabba's death is intriguing. Only... it should have been told a lot better. Which brings us to the negatives:The most glaring problem is that the overall structure of the season was just atrocious. There were already some issues in the first four episodes. The show felt a bit unfocused, repetitive and meandering. But that was nothing compared to the problems that would arrive with the next two episodes, when the show just kind of stopped. Like... it just went outside for a cigarette break for two whole episodes and then only came back for the final one. The decision to put two episodes of The Mandalorian inside BoBF, where Boba Fett barely appears, is objectively odd, but more importantly: it destroys the momentum of the story. When we finally come back to the main plot for only the conclusion, it ends up feeling rushed.It also sucks that the structural flaws of the show extend beyond itself and also ruin future Mandalorian binge-watches. Years from now, anyone looking to watch the whole of The Mandalorian will get a massive whiplash entering Season Three. The impact of Season Two's ending will immediately disappear because of the decision to make a hidden mini-Season Three as a part of The Book of Boba Fett. Truly baffling.Another plot issue is that the main conflict was just not interesting. You never really understand or care about any of the sides that are fighting, and that includes Boba Fett himself, whose plan never felt concrete to me. So, it feels like the show is about very little and building towards very little.The show's second-most glaring problem is the characters. It's inexcusable that I watched through a whole season of The Book of Boba Fett without getting a true understanding of the character of Boba Fett. I didn't get his motivation, I didn't really understand why he was on Tatooine (other than it being a fan-favorite location) or why it was so very important to him. The writers seemed to be going for him looking for his place or his community. But... why? The character seemed like a lone wolf in the original films. And now he's also all these strong, noble values which there were few indications of before. He's become almost a lawful-good Paladin-type.And the show never actually justifies Boba Fett's inclusion in his own (supposed) story. He's not essential for anything that truly works in the show and nothing about him feels fully fleshed out. I had the thought, close to the end of the season, that it would have been better and made more sense without Boba and with Cobb Vanth as the main character. Just a fully Western Star Wars story about a space sheriff trying to clean up his planet and stop a gang war. Probably with a healthy dose of influence from Yojimbo.Another astoundingly underdeveloped character was Fennec Shand, Boba's right-hand woman. I genuinely cannot describe her in any way except ""a good fighter"" and ""sarcastic"". After all those episodes, I simply do not know who she is, why she does what she does or why she is so loyal to Boba Fett.And finally, to hammer down how much the show failed on the character front, it ends with a big battle, where pretty much all the season's characters are in danger... and I didn't care about any of them based on the previous episodes. Either I already cared pre-BoBF or I didn't.No, wait. That's not right. There was one exception: I actually cared about the rancor. The rancor was very good, very precious. No harm must come to the rancor.In conclusion: The Book of Boba Fett is a good-looking and sometimes enjoyable mess of a show which never justifies itself, never makes the plot truly engaging or the main characters work. It has structural issues so massive that they're hard to comprehend and has robbed me of a lot of the faith I previously had in Filoni's & Favreau's vision for the future of small-screen Star Wars.Oh, and one more problem I want to mention: I know this is unpopular, but I hate CG-Luke. He always feels cold and wrong to me. If I imagine an audience coming to these shows having never seen the original movies, I don't see them experiencing joy from the Luke appearances, I see them viewing him as off-putting and unlikeable and not trusting him with Grogu. There is an important human touch missing from this version of him.",1,1,/user/ur7001024/?ref_=tt_urv

I forgot that Disney had dug their claws into Star Wars and ripped out the soul...
This was awful. This was a waste of my time entirely.From start to finish I would have been better off just watching Clone Wars and Bad Batch episodes on repeat then subject myself to what turned out to be episodes 1-4 of the Book of Boba 2 episodes of Mando and a finale that SUCKED!!!

Ep. 2 for example was great, wonderful lore, world building and character development from Boba. I think from there on he should have become the driving force in this show. But instead, he just accepts the opinions of the side characters to be better than his own.The ""worst"" thing about the show is strangely also the best one: Ep. 6. This was by far the most beautiful piece of Star Wars media in the last years. It was so tastefully done and so precise, such a wonderful development for Luke and Grogu. BUT how does this tie in to Boba´s story? It doesn´t!Yes, it affects Din somehow, but the development of a show centred around Boba, no. And this is the saddest part. I love Temuera Morrison, he is such a great guy and he understands the character of Boba very much, with other words he is Boba! But to disregard him and the character was the wrong decision. The side characters just have to much screen time and steal the show from Boba.Besides Eps. 2, 5 and 6 the show is sadly kinda boring and does no justice to Boba Fett.I really hope there will be a second season which focuses more on Boba, maybe it will take place on another planet (Tatooine is used to much in my opinion).And one detail I think is very important with Boba: mystery!

Since young I always enjoyed the star wars series it had it's own kind of directory. Even when the prequels came always saw the resemblance between the movies. Now in a new era and we notice that Disney took over the franchise. You can see it as bad addition or good. Disney has made a beautiful but different remake of star wars. We all know the MCU avenger series and how their main focus was mostly cgi and plot twists. But mostly everyone loved it. That's why I was really scared they took over the star wars franchise. Because it was made so beautiful and different than al the other movies of that time. But after the new disney star wars films I was really sad because of the way they miss treated the story of Sequel and prequel (I II III IV V VI). The original movies ended the story really good so they didn't have to squeeze out the content. But now with the new mandalorian and bobba fett I really was surprised by how good they handled it. They used a few elements from the MCU but still focussed on the character development from star wars before disney.

I'm not going to lie and say it was awful. To be honest, anything with the name ""Star Wars"" tends to fully captivate me. But that doesn't mean that as a Star Wars fan I was satisfied. That being said, I still think that overall you'll enjoy it.GOOD:
Temuera Morrison did an amazing job as was expected and it was really nice seeing Mando.Also SOME of the characters that were introduced really added a lot of much needed flavor.NOT SO GOOD:
Where I feel like they missed the mark is with the writing of Boba going through such drastic character changes. This guy was a bad dude before the events of the show. I mean ITS IMPLIED in The Empire Strikes Back that he killed Luke's aunt and uncle with fire. But it's almost like the writers were afraid to dive into the complexity of the character and instead just watered him down.I was hoping for more of a ""Punisher""-esque character arch but the show makes it feel like he was just some nice guy all along. It just came across as bland and I feel bad for Temeura because he truly carried this show on his back with his performance.Not only that, the plot and conclusion were... just unoriginal. There's no other way to put it. The ending felt like they just sort of did enough to scrape by. Again, I'm not saying it was awful by any means.

Ep2 really starts amping up the story and gives us a really good flashback story with how Boba Fett goes from dying in the sands of Tatooine, to tusken slave, to full fledged member of the tuskens. It gave me 'The last Samurai' vibes mixed with a western. I am also happy it gave the Tusken raiders some more humanity and depth than we have ever seen, as they have normally been portrayed as barbarian savages with little emotion like in the prequels.Now with the present day plot we have Boba trying to start his criminal empire in Tatooine but not having much presence, if any, as he is not parading around like the hutts or striking fear into the hearts of the people which leads to him being surrounded and injured by hired assassins. This part of Ep1 was quite a bit off for me as Boba could have just grabbed fennec and flown out of there but I guess the plot needed him to get injured so he goes into the bacta tank to heal and we get more flashbacks of what happened after ROTJ. The next episode we then have him bring the assassin captured by Fennec to the mayor to see why he sent them to kill him, however the mayor says it wasnt him. This leads to an event which is the Hutts appearing and with that a big power struggle for future episodes which hopefully will be very interesting.Black Krrsantan (the dark wookiee) a former employee of Jabba and fellow bounty hunter to Boba makes an apperance with the twin Hutts.

tt13668894,ur139473078,6,21 February 2022,"The series starts out pretty average. The first couple episodes cover Boba Fett's attempt at taking control of Mos Espa previously controlled by Jabba the Hutt, and him reliving his past after escaping a near death experience in the Sarlacc Pit. Here's where the problem lies for me and from what it looks like a lot of fans. The Show doesn't know which story to choose, I was constantly getting invested in a story-line just for it to switch to the other before it got interesting. I was more annoying than enjoyable. I think the first 3 episodes should have been dedicated to telling the post-Sarlacc Pit story. It would have made the story more linear and given the other 7 episodes enough runtime to build up the story. I also didn't like how they made Boba ""weak"". I think trying to make Boba old and slow doesn't really work since its maybe a couple years after the return of the Jedi, where he was arguably in his prime. He's not the badass bounty hunter so many of us have come to love, and even if he is somehow a lot older, it would've been better to try to show his resourcefulness, his ingenuity, and his experience. Instead we see a Boba Fett that tries to fix all the problems by being likeable.Episodes 5 and 6 were honestly fantastic. It felt like the Mandalorian again, which was good but also felt out of place, its a show about Boba Fett, and my favorite episodes were the ones he didn't even appear in.I didn't like the ending, it left much to be desired. The conflict that got me really interested in the story was ended before it even got a chance to start, Cad Bane who was a fantastic character in the clone wars, got killed off instantly. I don't like the ""Villain always survives to fight another day"" cliché but it could've created a fantastic rivalry for future seasons.I still think this show has great potential, I look forward to a second season.",1,3,/user/ur139473078/?ref_=tt_urv
tt13668894,ur140823199,9,18 February 2022,"Overall I enjoyed every single Minute of this show but it still had some problems.Chapter 1 A Stranger in a Strange Land: I Think it was a decent start for a show. I Think it was important to know what happend to Boba After Return of the Jedi and how he became the one we saw in The Mandalorian.Chapter 2 The Tribes of Tatooine : An Amazing Episode with a lot of things you know from other Westerns like the Train Chase. Also seeing the Hutts again was really nice. I wished they would've be the main villains of the show. Learning more about the tuskens was very interesting and seeing Boba as a teacher was cool.Chapter 3 The streets of Mos Espa: This was my least favourite Episode of the series. I Think many poeple have the same opinion. But why is it my least favourite episode? I keep it short: The biker Gang of Mos Espa. Especially the Chase scene through Mos Espa. Also that the Hutts just got away after One episode was very lame. But seeing Krrsantan in Action was nice.Chapter 4 The Gathering Storm : After Chapter 3 this Episode was beautiful. It was another Flashback Episode and i liked it. Seeing the Slave 1 again was so nice and Hearing the seismic charge was satisfying as hell. Finally Boba had a badass moment with the slave 1 where he gets revenge to the Gang who ,,killed"" his Tusken Family.Chapter 5 The Return of the Mandalorian : Omg I love this Episode. The Return of the Mandalorian was perfect but I have One big problem with this Episode. This was Mandalorian Season 2.5. Boba has no screen time in this Episode, but Mandos story was so interesting that I didnt care about Boba.Chapter 6 From the Desert comes a Stranger : I didn't thought it could be better, but this Episode was perfect for a Mandalorian Episode but not for Boba. The Return of Luke, Ashoka, Cobb Vanth Cad Bane and Grogu was Beautiful and i sat in front of my PC with my mouth open for every second. The Cliffhanger at the end was epic and seeing Cad Bane in Life Action fighting Cobb Vanth was exiting. But Boba had a screen time of like 10 seconds and i thought that was bad.Chapter 7 In the Name of Honor: It was a perfect Finale for me. Seeing Boba riding a Rancor ans finally getting the Action he deserves. Also Mando and Grogu united again was a perfect set up for Mando Season 3. The Action was Epic and the end with Mando and Grogu was so Sweet.At the end i thought this show was amazing. Especially the last 3 Episode saved a lot of Things and this show even if mostly takes Part on one planet has massive World Building. Seeing Boba and Mando fight together was very cool and the duel between Cad Bane and Boba was Intense. The Music of this Show is incredible I Love Ludwig Görranson. This show had some mistakes like the amount of Bobas screen time in some of the Episodes and some lame Chase scenes.

tt13668894,ur142776774,3,11 February 2022,"Ah yes, classic Disney Star Wars.It seems to always be one step forward and two steps back for this beloved franchise. After the massive success of The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett seemed like it may deliver on the same great storytelling, world-building, and characterisation that Disney finally captured with Mando. However, taking more of a page from the mishandled sequel trilogy more than anything, this series feels uninspired and haphazardly written.The flashback sequences had some merit, with some nice background on the world of Tatooine and its local species. But seeing Boba saved by the Tusken Raider's takes away from the character being tough as nails and surviving only due to sheer determination. The rest of the show rips away any charm that remains of both its titular character and Tatooine. Boba is shoved in the background most of the time, with others making strategic or worthwhile choices for him and the action being boring and lifeless. Not to mention two whole episodes that are dedicated to other characters, with the reunion of Mando and Grogu dissolving any impact the season 2 finale gave their journey. Why have Grogu leave to train with Luke if he is going to go back to Mando literally straight away? The show makes some absurd choices for the plot and it loses all narrative traction.The Book of Boba Fett could've been anything else and it would have been better. It could've been a revenge journey of Boba trying to track down Han Solo. It could have included flashbacks of how Jango raised Boba and the lessons he gave him. It could have included Cad Bane as an antagonist, with Boba's journey mirroring Bane's as an example of where he might end up if he continued on his path. It could have explored the world of bounty hunting some more and brought in familiar characters like other bounty hunters such as Dengar (with Black Krrsantan actually having an important role to the story). The Book of Boba Fett should have shown why Boba Fett has this incredible legacy as a character, instead of tearing it all down.Oh yeah, and some guy does a 360 no scope at the end.

Only episode 2 gave us that and helped us understand Boba's change from who he was. That was one outstanding episode. But that one episode wasn't enough to explain why he wanted to run a crime syndicate. Why not run for governor or something else? Especially when he wanted to clean up the streets.Ironically, the show was much better when it didn't feature Boba. Maybe the lack of identity for both it's main character and title mismanaged expectations?Had the title been something else like 'The Sands of Tatooine' or anything that is realted to the broader ongoings on the planet... this show would have been rated higher. Either cut down 2 or 3 episodes. Or instead, tie-in Boba/ Santo/ Mando/ Cobb's stories together, showing their personal stakes at risk and how & why they needed to come together to fight the Pikes.

Boba pardons 2 Gamorreans who swear their loyalty to him so they head out in a group of four (by their feet?! It seems so unspectacular like a WoW guild just strolling around) in the city because someone disrespected the new ""daimyo"" (for some reason they love the word, they´re using it all the time). Some assassins attack >long parkour chase >prisoner says it was the mayor >mayor sends boba somewhere else because he didnt do it >the real bad guys seem to be the Hutts. It feels unnatural to me how every event immediately leads to another and its honestly like playing a videogame, always running after new quests.From time to time there are some flashbacks from Boba´s trauma and his time with the sandpeople (who are strangely open minded, not really like in the books etc but hey its a family-friendly production so no big surprise I guess) after he came out of the Sarlacc. I feel like I´ve seen this story of some locals being taught to defend themselves too often in this universe (e.g. TCW 1.13,1.14,2.17;Mandalorian 1.4)(also why is Boba´always so nice and cares but ig its okay hes alwáys got his own motives) and my personal interest was not exactly how the Tusken´s weapons are made or some dance choreos but like 1/5 of the second episode was just that :)There are some weird aspects in those two episodes that just dont make much sense or that are contradicting books and comics but this was pretty much the case with The Mandalorian too. My problem is that watching The Mandalorian was at least entertaining, while I think The Book of Boba Fett just isnt to be taken seriously so far.The only good thing was Temuera Morrison, who tried to but some of Fett´s mercilessness and vengeance into his acting and sinergized well with Ming-Na Wen, also doing a good job.(Im not a professional critic, just a disappointed non-english speaking boy, so please excuse my language and my random rant text lol)",17,27,/user/ur144392254/?ref_=tt_urv

If you recall, Temurea played Jango Fett, the man who the clones were made from. Boba Fett is one of those clones. Now, we move forward in time and Boba has taken his father's armor, making it his own and becomes the bounty hunter we have all grown to know. So, for those who are bashing on Temurea playing Boba Fett, technically speaking... he is Boba Fett a clone of his father, Jango Fett.Moving on. Episode 1 of the series starts off kind of sketchy. In the end though it explains a lot. We finally get to see Boba succumb his untimely demise at the hands of Han Solo. Finally, the theory of how he escaped the Sarlac pit was put on screen! We see how he manages to lose his armor, greedy Jawas! Then we see the Tusken Raiders show up. Shining light on how Boba Fett survived the desert. For those who are saying the creature Boba Fett slayed looked like Goro from MK... It's a sci-fi show. Aliens aren't allowed to have four arms? Come on...
Episode 2: This was a huge wow to me. Seeing Jabas brother and sister? Not expecting that. Then we get to learn how Boba became an expert gaffi stick wielder. In this episode we learn he was trained very heavily in the Tusken arts. His return in Mandolorian season 2 would show he is relentless with a gaffi stick.For a character taken out so shamelessly... Bobas return in Mandolorian Season 2 would bring ferocity and anger to Bobas character. In my eyes, they brought him back in the way it was intended. Never did we get to see Boba Fett really fight. Now, we know my man, Boba Fett is a force not to be reckoned with.Side Note: Since Disney's take over of Star Wars, it's not been the same. Honestly, Star Wars has lost meaning to me, thanks to all the changing and changes coming... sad. Mandolorian and Boba Fett have become Star Wars to me. So sad that a major corporation like Disney would do what they have done. Even Lucas is making changes to his greatest creation.

tt13668894,ur147730478,2,12 January 2022,"Up until know I can only scratch my head and wonder what drove the makers of this series to make the creative decisions they made. They way this story is told is highly dissatisfying with flashbacks in each episode that take up more than half of its length. These flashbacks, while being relevant to the story, are not enticing to watch because we all know that nothing is going to happen to Boba Fett. It feels like a boring distraction from the main story. Regarding the main story I must say that I just can't imagine who wrote and who approved this script. There have been two assassination attempts on Boba Fett by so called experts and they were a huge mess logically as well as cinematically. Tons of opportunities to just complete the mission are left unused and everything just looks very slow and badly choreographed. The speeder chase in episode three looks very slow and unexciting, while the costume design for the so called ""youths"" horrendous and just looked out of place and cheap. There are so many good gangster series and films out there that could have been an inspiration to this setting with interesting characters and great ""building up an empire"" story arcs. What we get is a dumbed down Boba Fett who constantly does not know what is going on and seems to have lost all his swagger in that damn pit.

tt13668894,ur147755158,2,31 December 2021,"In storytelling, there are five promises that the story has to give quicky to gain trust and get a person invested. 1) A character 2) A Voice/Viewpoint 3) A world 4) A problem 5) An event. The Book of Boba Fett (this with only one episode out atm) struggles to do these things which leaves the viewer out of the story and not invested at all.1. With number one, a character, the story relies heavily on the viewer already knowing who Boba Fett is, which is fine, many stories rely on prior knowledge, but it doesn't establish where he is now/the situation he is in. It seems intentional, as a plot device, to deepen the story, but when you do that, it strains the viewers trust. So, the other four promises have to be completely solid...sadly they are not.2. With number two, a voice, it's not sooo bad except...all the shots, angles, and music scream comedy, while the context clues tell the viewer it's not. It is very off-putting and feels fake. They need to choose one, comedy or drama. (not to mention the horrific fight scene with...ninjas? *shutter*)3. With number three, a world, they again rely heavily on prior knowledge of the Star Wars universe, which works in this case for...the most part. (see number two)4. Now we get to number four, a problem, and boy do we have a problem. Boba survives the sarlacc pit (obviously). He then gets captured (spoilers) and continues to fight despite his exhaustion. (also, why is he already old???) We flash forward and he is the new Jabba, (again more awful acting) where he is just oblivious to everything despite all his experience as a bounty hunter. (rocket into a shield anyone?) and...the list keeps going.5. !@#$% *more bad acting* (see number four)Yeah, its awful. Total garbage.

I won't compare it to the Mandalorian or any other Star Wars content over all, because that would go too far.In the year of 2021/22 with the budget of Disney, i would expect way more than this. I've acknowledged that Disney don't care/understand (about) the legacy of star wars, but failing again on it is just a joke.No tension, no surprises, bad fights, unmotivated character and the CGI is just a joke.How can it be that a gaming publisher is able to create a way better story arc for their characters (Arcane) then Disney...That's not Boba Fett that's a guy using the same armour like Boba...1 star, because of the flashback to episode 2

It's insulting to fans and to the show itself- The title of the series, is literally called ""Boba Fett."" As a true Star Wars fan, this was epic! I loved all the cameos and easter eggs for fans. You can tell that every detail has been carefully researched and specifically made for those that love this universe. There were many different species that we haven't seen much of in live action. Keep it coming.I love how the writers are building a sense of community, leadership and family amongst the Tusken Raiders. Until now, they have been seen as monsters or animals, especially after what happened in Attack of the Clones. Now Anakin's actions are far more real and terrifying, that he killed, ""not just the men, but the women and children too."" Cold.We finally got to see how Boba survived after Return of the Jedi, which upto now, has only been speculated and talked about. Yes we all knew he survived the Sarlaac Pit, but never have we ""seen"" it. So thank you writers of this show, that was a cool scene.True at the end of the episode, we wonder, ""what is going on,"" or ""I have so many questions about what is happening next."" But isn't that the point, hook us in, wanting more so that we come back for the next episode.

Boba Fett is clearly the star of the show so it is obvious the other characters aren't going to get as much screen time but I wasn't all that mad since he is still an interesting character.Now, when I was about to write my review on IMDb I didn't expect THIS much backlash for the show. Like people out here are giving it FREAKING 1/10s, LIKE WHAT?! Ok sure, it ain't no ""Mandalorian"" levels of good but people are forgetting that IT IS THE FREAKING PILOT. Pilots are meant to setup the story with the characters, the setting, the themes, and the tone WHICH THIS PILOT FREAKING DID!For the people who think this is just copying the Mandalorian, it's predecessor, then they are wrong. Both feel like completely different shows with their tones, setups, and goals. The mandalorian was a more western show, while TBOBF is more Arabian/Egyptian with its main character not focusing on redemption and rather on being a good follow up to a crimelord, like a young boy who is forced to be a pharaoh after the death of his father. Like damn, I have never seen that in a Star Wars media, and I can't wait for them to expand upon it in the future. Who ever thinks they are the same show can fight me!People are saying that it is too ""fanservice-y"" which is just bs, I've seen too fanservice-y, One piece, is too fanservice-y.

What an absolute dumpster fire. The best two episodes had nothing to do with Boba Fett. With the exception of those two episodes, which were actually pretty great, the rest continued to be wretched for all the reasons listed below. I finished the season angry that this series was such a massive let down. Also, Cad Bane deserved better. Complete disservice to end the finale for Cad Bane the way they did. And, it goes without saying, the finale as a whole was terrible. It left me wishing the death star was still around for just one more hit. Honestly, to list all the things that sucked about this show would take an entire book. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 are because the 2 Mando episodes. Everything should be killed with fire.I read a few professional reviews after I watched the first 2 episodes and I just don't get it. Why do people think Morrison is a good actor? The writing surely doesn't do him any favors, but the delivery is... well there just isn't any. Too be fair, I thought he was a poor choice for the prequels too. If the whole point of the clones is to make a ""super race"" of bad guys, why did you pick one of the least polarizing actors you could find? So now, in this series you've got one of the most boring, ""safe"" actors who's moving around and looking like a geriatric patient and it's just accepted for some reason. Hell, when they used Hamill in the Mandalorian it didn't look like he might break a hip at any moment. And dude, those teeth. Just what everyone wants is to picture the most mysterious bounty hunter putting his dentures into a glass next to his nightstand before bed. The dude is just way too old to play this role and it shows. Also, here's a spoiler, the first episode is almost exclusively nothing but annoying screeching sounds.A perfect microcosm of the show is the fight scene with ninjas. The CGI is so bad and nothing about how they are fighting makes sense. He does splatter a guy with a rocket at the very end, which looked cool. It's almost a surprise because you are shocked to see him do something that makes sense. Man, honestly, the more I write, the more pissed off I get. The story is so incredibly disjointed and weak. The supporting characters are simple and forced. The writing bloooows. The props and CGI are just ok. It really sucks. I felt the same way when they ruined my other favorite character, Solo (tell me the dude playing Han wouldn't be more aptly fit to be a nerd on The Big Bang Theory).But, the visuals/ scenery are decent sometimes. So there's that.Honestly, if this show was called Sandy Old Space Man and not The Book of Boba Fett I wouldn't keep watching it, but because I'm a simp for SW I'll finish it. I'm probably not going to be happy about it though. I'll put it this way, the only way anyone could give this better than a 6/10 is if they genuinely think ""I hate sand"" is good writing.

It's like they have tried to make it more modern and up to date but I'm looking for it to be more like the first three movies .Really disappointing is an understatement and not much more to say than that .,8,10,/user/ur148345008/?ref_=tt_urv
tt13668894,ur148362812,6,13 January 2022,"First review ever and that is only because i felt the need to almost complain about this series and the beloved boba Fett character.It was the fact he was mysterious and bad ass that we all fell in love with the galaxies best and most fearsome bounty Hunter. His reputation went before him and all feared him. Please if you can read the 'Wagner' boba Fett story to see how ruthless this bounty Hunter was in pursuit of his prey.This all brings me to this series...three episodes in and we have seen boba ass kicked by sand people, by ninja assassins and now by a fellow bounty Hunter wookie- he has been saved from death in all three by the interventions of others. His fear factor has gone, the series has made him frail and his reputation shattered. The fact he speaks so much also ruins his mysterious aura that attracted us to him for many many years (says a 50 old man who never grew out of the original films).I loved the mandalorian and the Fett episode where he destroys the stormtroopers and reclaims his armour had me actually crying like a baby with how bad ass he was. Shortly after in the next episode the writers then made him get beat up in a canteen by a fellow mandalorian and my fear of what they might do with this series began.Apologies for the lengthy first-ever review, but this series is so disappointing on so many levels that it has really upset a die hard fan to the extent that I have had to write this.The disappointment of what has happened, what could have been (and the budget available) leaves a really sad feeling for anyone who grew up knowing what this character

tt13668894,ur148428838,1,15 January 2022,"I have to admit I didn't mind the Mandalorian. It had decent character development and the occasional blip of humour. The second Mando series was less good with repetitive storylines and no meaningful development of the story arc. This is where Boba Fett comes in. Little did I know that the second Mandalorian series was going to be the quality setting for ""The Book of Boba Fett"". I binged the first three episodes and I really can't see much point in continuing to watch. I'm sure the fanbois are delighted to have any new Star Wars themed content but as far as I'm concerned, that's all this series has got going for it.The production is lifeless, with two dimensional characters and boring dialog. The script seems to have been written by a 12 year old doing a school assignment. Disney, as always, treads the safest path they can, probably putting every spoken element to a committee for approval. The result is nothing more creative than a made-for-tv cowboy show from the 60's. What the production has turned the Boba Fett character into is the well meaning Sheriff in the lawless town. The script then sees this character ""go native"" in flashbacks when he is tested then embraced by the indigenous people. Then we have the pathetic assassination attempt by the ""corrupt Official"". All the while he's shadowed by the, now compulsory, ""strong female"" character. Next he goes out to quell the ""rebel group"" and ends up co-opting them (they also have their own strong female). Now with a bit of humour and interpersonal banter, all this could be quite interesting despite being so cliché but no. No its dreary, slow paced and wooden... thanks Disney.Visually, there's nothing to offend the Star Wars fanbase, they've included a big cast of recognisable creatures, right down to the musicians in the casino/bar/tavern. The props all scream Star Wars too. But where's the visual energy? Even the chase scene with the (ridiculously nice) scooters chasing the Mayors assistant was dull. It all smacks of ""made for fan kids"" and you can just see the mech in it's store packaging when you see the props.In conclusion, this series does nothing positive for the franchise as a work of visual entertainment. No effort has been put into the writing that would make it appealing to anyone older than 12 and maybe we would have to conclude that the writers are incapable of creating such a script. It's pretty obvious now that Disney aims to just milk the franchise and turn out flavourless, shabby content.",7,10,/user/ur148428838/?ref_=tt_urv

Boba Fett's in every episode but a bounty hunter isn't. The character does nothing but walk around and I just can't get a feeling for any other character. I was expecting some great missions and a bit of silent toughness with a bit of mystery around Boba Fett thrown in but was left with an old guy going for strolls and always taking his helmet off (that was just a personal annoyance).

He spares every life he can, thinks he's above torture, and is the worst slave ever. Like do the writers seriously expect us to just sit back and watch as the tusken child leads around two slaves by himself. Not only is the writing unbelievably bad, but so are action sequences. Boba acts like an unwieldy teenager and unlike a professional killer while also refusing to use guns as much as he can. All in all it feels like Disney tried their very hardest to make a show that the entire family could watch, that is, if your family is comprised completely of 3-8 year olds, because any older and they won't be able to watch the massacre of a beloved character.

Speaking of which, since when does Boba Fett take off his helmet this much?The action is plodding, and clunky at best. The story is boring, and the dialogue is atrocious.

This is already a big plus, since at the time of the release of the films, critics praised the actor very much for the good disclosure of the character. Secondly, a large number of references to the original universe (whether it's the Death of Jabba Khattab, the ""original"" Tatooine with all its features, well, all the other nuances, including the manner of Fett's movement).

tt13668894,ur149420788,1,22 February 2022,"^ That's literally the theme music.This show was an opportunity spoiled. Boba Fett was THE dude from the original films that everyone wanted more of. But now I wish he had stayed dead until a more serious attempt was made to continue his story.With editing more suited for the sci fi channel then Disney, weird dialog and even weirder delivery, TBOBF is an objectively terrible show.The entire thing just feels thrown together and rushed like a middle school theater project, almost as if the entire production thought they were doing season 3 of the mandelorian until 2 weeks before shooting.... Unfortunately, none of the intriguing characters, and spaghetti western style of the Mandelorian made it over to TBOBF.As a Star wars fan, I can obviously forgive bad acting/ choppy cadence in exchange for something. Think about episode I, now that's a garbage movie, but you got some epic battle sequences, cool scenery, space battles, Natalie Portman and the duel of fates with Darth Maul.What do I get with the BOBF? Nothing. Not only does the entire thing happen on the invigorating desert wasteland planet of Tatooine, but nothing about Fetts current status even makes sense.Apparently, in this version of star wars, anyone with more than 15 henchmen can control the entirety of organized crime operations on Tatooine, and unfortunately Fett only has 1, his side chick assassin you may remember from the Mandelorian. They're up against the ""crime syndicate"" who are there to move the desert ""Spice"" from Dune (they don't even try to make it different) through Fetts domain. Fett, who has inherited Jabbas whole operation, with one employee.That is until he recruits the local emo teenage gang to be his muscle. With neon colored vespas straight out of a power rangers episode the half dozen or so 16 year olds join Fett as security and bring his total employee number to
10. Top speed: 8 mph.Boba Fett is supposed to be a crime lord of an entire city. He lives in the old Hutt palace as the new Hutt...Mystery aside, after the director of spy kids had his fun turning the Boba Fett story into a Saturday morning special for little kids, Disney clearly felt they had to do something drastic and randomly brought back the mandelorian in arguably the only good episode in the season.His character adds some well needed intrigue but wasn't enough to change the trajectory of this train wreck.This series never felt like it had any clear artistic vision. Rather, it felt like a slew of random directors who felt the need to leave an artistic ""flair"" that no one asked for.Its not just the vespa scooters or an entire episode about LS swapping a vintage naboo star fighter, there is something off about this version of the star wars universe I cant describe.The action sequences are comical but I guess that was to be expected. What I can't portray to the reader is really how weird and choppy and nonsensical the scene placement is. It truly does feel like a computer algorithm wrote the ending:I think at one point cade bane scares away the rancor with his little wrist flame thrower. (The same one that just brutally beat down two enormous shield droidekas.) Then he is killed in an epic showdown with Fett. Whatever. The end.Wrong.Immediate cut scene after the most dramatic point in the show back to the forgotten rancor from 10 min ago...which is now running amok king kong style scaring the town's folk until subdued by grogu. Okay.?Now the end.Wrong.The side chick assassin kills the leadership of the rival gang. Thats it folks. No dramatic confrontation between Fett and the people hes been fighting all season. Nothing. Why would there be?Boba fett hands a wookie a desert melon, one of the power rangers makes a bad joke, we all laugh. Camera Pans out. The end.1 nerf Herder out of 10.

tt13668894,ur149444598,7,2 February 2022,"While I wouldn't classify this show as a masterpiece, I would say it has a lot of potential. It's a pretty good expansion to the Star Wars universe that elaborates on certain aspects and backgrounds of the SWU that have thus far been left vague, whether that resonates with people is another story.I'll start off by just stating, that some of the people marking this below 5 seem to be picking apart the smallest details just for the sake of finding something wrong with it, to those people I would simply say if you don't like it, just stop/don't watch it, it's not going to affect your everyday life.To those complaining about Boba Fett removing his helmet frequently, there's a simply answer to that, which is addressed in The Mandalorian, Boba doesn't consider himself a Mandalorian, he wears the armor due to the sentimentality attached to it, because of his father Jango, who was a Mandalorian but Boba never claimed to be which he states on his first encounter with Din Djarin. And even then, Din Djarin is part of a zealous religious sect of Mandalorians that follow the Way of Mandalore, they are a minority group, the majority population moved away from such practices well before the prequels.Others complaining about the lack of VFX on some of the alien races, technology and what not. I don't see the problem, there was an uproar online previously about how heavily used VFX was used during the prequel trilogy so I think Disney is trying to return to Lucasfilm's roots by utilizing make-up, puppets and live action effects and personally I think it's done really well, it preserves the original creativity of the first trilogy, I don't understand why people need / crave visual realism. This might be a Disney production but this isn't the Avengers / MCU, calm down it's not meant to appeal to everyone.To the series itself, there are some lacking aspects of course but if you treat it like a supplement or chapter of a bigger story it's actually quite impressive. Much like the Mandalorian it's filling in lore gaps between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens while also solidifying the canon of the animated series that a lot of casual fans have overlooked.While I don't really enjoy watching Boba get his ass kicked in most episodes which was a huge contrast to his introduction in the Mandalorian or the random vespa gang, it does make me better realize that not everyone is a Jedi, there are legitimate struggles for the ""average"" Star Wars character, which leaves room for a lot of character growth.TL;DR give it a chance, and don't treat it like the age old Star Wars story of Light vs Dark, Jedi vs Sith, this is the story of everyone else in-between.",0,0,/user/ur149444598/?ref_=tt_urv

tt13668894,ur149747724,4,9 February 2022,"It is not fair to rate TBOBF as a 7 episode show, because it's actually 5 episodes. Episodes 5 and 6 are a part of a completely different and way better tv show.It's honestly sad to me, even as someone who's never been the biggest fan of boba fett, that such an iconic SW character was done so dirty. This show really needed another draft or two. Because the episodes we got seriously don't come off as ones written by people who understand showrunning OR the character of boba fett.I'm going to give some suggestions on how this could have been worthwhile though.1) This show should have been in chronological order, the whole tusken storyline should have held more weight and shown us the actual transformation of Boba. Instead we got glimpses of the present where boba is acting really weird and the flashbacks are supposed to help us understand him but they don't. Why? Because the tuskens are dead by episode 2... this five year period that changes boba fett into a completely different character than the one we know and love is done in 2 episodes. Even less if you count out the boring scenes in the present. The tuskens should have either gotten half of a longer season, or an entire season, having season 2 be about daimyo boba.2)Daimyo Boba is dumb. They tried to make Boba into a Godfather leader figure, which can work in theory, except we don't actually see the people boba is supposed to rule... his court is completely empty. We never see the small town folk even interact with boba so when he says that they need him in the last episode it makes no sense: because boba isn't an actual leader of mos espa. We never see him that way. We only see him get constantly disrespected and ridiculed, and for some reason he lets most things pass. He wants to rule with respect but doesn't command it. Mando, Fennec, Cad even f---ing grogu all command more respect than him. He's actually like a teddy bear. It's insane. Even in the last episode when we *FINALLY* got to see boba do cool stuff, it felt weird because like Cad said, we don't really understand what his angle is. Is he a killer or a respectful ruler? When fennec assassinated the pykes that looked so badass and cool, that's what I expected from boba though. But this show didn't give that to us. I don't know how they want us to believe that the same badass old man from mando season 2 is this acting like this.3)The colorful bikes are dumb. So are the teens riding them, if we just forget about the fact that the redhead girl constantly got away with disrespecting boba, the famed bounty hunter, the designs of her entire gang are so out of place for tattooine and look so terrible that i actually laughed everytime they were on screen during the last episode.Overall, this show was really disappointing.

Boba Fett is no longer the badass that we know who would take over a crime syndicate for the power and control; he takes over a crime syndicate only to end... crime...? Hmm. This is boring Boba.

Just because your show has laser guns and floating vehicles doesn't mean a generic chase scene is any less generic. Episodes 5 and 6 are fantastic; the show takes a small break to give us some Mandalorian content. The two episodes have great cinematography that is somehow miles better than the rest of the show.

Those so called ""clichés"" are of the better kind.It was good for Boba Fett, this infamous and trained character, not being protected by ""plot armor"" (like Din Djarin); shattering the expectations of some SW fans.Yes, the not-so-expressive acting may be among the reasons the most didn't enjoy the series that much, but the existence and importance of ""character actors"" should be normalized. While in some it's versatility, in others It's the playing of simple and stable personalities that deserves the praise. At least in my eyes, not being expressively emotional does not equal the performer being talentless. Temuera Morrison obviously enjoyed every minute of filming and was enthusiastic about the project.I'm not saying the series has no flaws at all. The episodes featuring Din Djarin alone are not among the negatives, no matter how often I see this brought up first as reasoning against the series.Boba Fett's years with the Tuskens didn't require more episodes. They and their habits were presented nicely, with just the right emotional intensity the scenes needed.The introduction of psychedelics / mind-altering drugs was kind of and unexpected move. The series also tried to present the subculture of the young generation living on the planet bringing the world even closer to the current modern ages, but It's this attempted parallel that forms too much contrast with what the series presents in the other half.

The reason why it's better than most of the recent movies and shows that I have seen because the Book of Boba Fett didn't have me turning off the TV unlike other shows and films I couldn't watch all the way through.

The special effects are very poor, the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, the fight scenes are hilariously poor and even the lighting is off. There are so many rookie mistakes in this I doubt it would do well if it was fan-fiction.There are so many contradictions throughout that made me genuinely laugh out loud at how stupid things are. For example Boba Fett forgets he has a jetpack on him every time it could be useful. The last episode made Boba Fett out like he had serious dementia at times forgetting things that have happened in previous episodes.Most of the characters do things that make no sense for their character. Boba Fetts character is probably the most inconsistent too. How a TV show with such a huge budget can be so mediocre in so many ways is shocking to me.",7,8,/user/ur150222955/?ref_=tt_urv

I did not think he was ""cool"" in any way. Maybe a lost opportunity but that was the role he played.He was far more important as the original clone. His story was played out via them. They could have made about the same level of story using ""Pruneface"".But, my son said he watched it so I figured I would.This show is slow. Boring and slow. When he is riding the bantha for seemingly endless periods, that is the pace of the show. Fennec Shand is also a boring, robotic character. There is nothing redeeming about her.

Boba Fett must similarly have been confused with Salacious B. Crumb (that is apparently the name of the Kowakian monkey-lizard who sits on Jabbas shoulder and laughs). For what once was a dark and mysterious character, this series has a complete lack of mystery and is as dark as aunt Berus smoothies.The different character in this show are also no deeper than white dinner-plates splashed with a dash of watered out gravy. All the dialog could easily been replaced with Java sounds. The action scenes, who seems mostly mandatorily jammed into each episode without much context, are as thrilling as watching a kids carousel on slow (ref the episode 3 google colored scooter chase). The mystery of one of the most interesting characters in star wars is reduced to a man taking his helmet off before asking some obvious question or making some official statement worthy of Zapp Brannigan.

tt13668894,ur30145876,5,9 February 2022,"Alright, I generally don't do these. But, as some one who really fell with love Star Wars in the past decade, going through the OG trilogy, Prequels (even with their flaws), Rogue One, Clone Wars TV show, Force Unleashed & the Lego games. It's characters, the world & its philosophy. I really loved it all. After the let's say mediocre ""sequel"" trilogy, The Mandalorian felt like a breath of fresh air. It really digged deep into it's root of the western and samurai media & culture, yet offered something new to the fans while remaining honest & true to the world built by George Lucas. So after Mandalorian Season 2 finale teasing this show I was hyped. I though ""yes, finally we might be getting the dark, gritty take and exploring the underworld of Star Wars that was promised in the Han Solo Spin-off, which was half-balked in it's attempt at most. Just like how The Mandalorian felt when it dropped first. I was hopeful from the early episode or 2, that we might get it. Few good action scenes, world building, flashbacks & finally a call to war. But nope, that had to make it Mandalorian 2.5 and not give a iconic character a proper story for him to carry, take the risk and make something new, bold, stylish and hardened.... I wanted more Crime lord, calling names, taking heads, building an Empire. Look I am a killer for nostalgia bait. I loved every single reference that was made and every character brought back, like even bringing Cade Bane back was a great choice felt like it would happen in this scenario. But I just wish this show wasn't that venue for Mando's arc with Grogo, his removal from the creed, Luke, Jedi Temple etc..I would have loved to see all that good down in Mandalorian Season 3 and something more (Read & saw some amazing fan stories regarding this) .

I honestly can not believe they did such a disservice to one of the most endearing and ominous characters in all of Star Wars.The Book of Boba Fett is a masterclass on what not to do with a character who is best known as a subtle and looming presence - bring him in to the light. Temura Morrison is old, far too old to reprise the role of Galaxy's Best Bounty Hunter. It doesn't even add up mathematically. At best they should have recast the man under the helmet and used Morrison's voice. Alas, this leads in to my next gripe - leave the helmet on! Boba Fett is the Helmet... Just as the Helmet makes Mando in The Mandalorian. Unfortunately, they've decided Morrison's wooden acting deserves more attention by taking the helmet off every 2 seconds.Jon Favreau and Robert Rodriguez make me think they've only ever seen Phantom Menace and have no idea what to do with this character.

One thing I really can't get into is the motorcycle speeders that the cyborg kids have. The colors and style don't fit with the aesthetics of Star Wars, at least to me.

tt13668894,ur36026249,7,19 February 2022,"It was probably the least thing that Lucas expected: a helmeted character shown in two movies with less than a few minutes of screen time, exploding into a cultural phenomenon. Thanks to Disney, Favreau, the Mandolorian, and Temuera Morrison, a character of a few minutes has now become among the biggest talk among nerds and entertainment circles alike.Temuera Morrison was viciously effective in his debut episodes of the Mandolorian. I saw an aged man, who had endured the belly of the sarlac pit, years of the sun beating down upon him on Tatooine, and a kind of rage behind his eyes. And then, Favreau let him loose and he absolutely proved to be the badass everyone thought he was, picking off and body slamming stormtrooper after stormtrooper.But something's different in this series. Morrison seems much more domesticated. His mysterious, rageful, cool reputation no longer preceded itself as he goes from villain to a respectable self-proclaimed ""Daimyo."" He's not quite a crime lord, he's no warlord, but he's not quite a mayor or governor. ""Daimyo,"" a Japanese lord, sounds good (I guess), so, let's go with that. But the series doesn't do much to convince us that this hardened badass, son of Jango Fett, a bigger badass, becomes a good guy. Sure, it delves into his history a bit with some disjointed episode-long flashbacks, but I just can't see how these flashbacks convince us that we should be rooting for Boba. After all, in the movies and animated series, this guy is a villain. If he's going to go from villain to protagonist, I need good reasons to respect and like him as the ""good guy."" And just as soon as we are trying to find those reasons, suddenly we feel like we are watching anything but a show about Boba Fett.The disjointed plot is another issue. We are introduced to some major Star Wars characters from various mediums, including the Clone Wars animated show, the movies, and the recent Mandolorian series. But as enjoyable as it is seeing them, they're not really thrown in there toward any obvious purpose. We aren't even sure who we should be rooting against. Is it it the Hutts? A gang? The Star Wars mafia? A lone gunslinger that makes his way from the Clone Wars? There is so much going on and so many convoluted ideas thrown in that the point of the series loses any sense of coherency.What saves The Book of Boba Fett from being the hot mess that it could have potentially been, of course, are the things that make every Star Wars endeavor interesting: familiar characters from different Star Wars mediums. A deep and creative universe filled with exotic alien races and cultures. The pew pew pewing of laser gun shoot outs. The different types of intergalactic mores that clash between force wielders, bounty hunters, power-mongers, soldiers, and galactic citizens. Despite all the incoherency, we are still treated to some eye-popping surprises and wickedly awesome subplots that we will need to hold onto for future Star Wars stories. And then there is the appearance of a famous villain of Star Wars lore toward the latter half of the series. He is every bit as menacing and vicious as we thought he would be.And so The Book of Boba Fett isn't a complete failure. Despite the incoherent madness of the series, there are episodes which show off glorious happenings of other characters we are highly interested in. And there is a very enjoyable subplot that actually involves Boba, as we see his development from a bounty hunter to a tough martial arts warrior and respected member of a community. Perhaps that is the problem with the Book of Boba, is that it is not a waste of time, but it could have been phenomenal, and yet it's ability to serve any purpose makes it quite forgettable.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur36026249/?ref_=tt_urv

Maybe that wasn't what the writers intended, but when you give a character such a significant roll in another show, it's only fair to expect the same level of excitement and thrill. But the Book of Boba Fett did not achieve that same level. The writers wanted it all, but it almost looked like they couldn't get it onto the screen properly. It was a good thing that they showed the concept art after each episode, because sometimes the art showed more depth than the actual episode.For example: the car chase seen looked very exciting in the concept art, but was really awkward, almost childish and amaturistic in the actual episde. Same goes for almost the entire season final. The best episodes were the ones where they made a side step to The Mandalorian which only proved that the Book of Boba Fett walks in the shadows of The Mandalorian.But all of this aside, I did like the series. Despite some cheesy scenes, there were some very cool easter eggs, surprises and call-backs. Even some new, very cool characters. Despite what most people say, I actually liked the whole flash back time line in which we learn how Boba survived the Sarlacc Pitt and came to live with the Tuscans. It gave more insight into everything that happend after Return of the Jedi. Very cool! And let's be honest. Boba Fett is a really bad ass character.

none of them are interesting, seem to have an arc, are played well nor memorable in any waystory:
is there any? It's all boring and lame and the few plotpoints / storybits are done a million times better in other showsdesign/worldbuilding:
at least the prequels had the intention to find some new designlanguage, maybe it was offputting, because it did not really fit the design-tone established by mcquarrie and fellows, but it added something, since then anything is just bland and has no real profile..or in case of Boba Fett: then it sticks in a bad way, like the power ranger vespas from Ep. 3.Who's also sick of Tattoine? (or Jakku)
Tattoine was precisely used to show, that it's the farthest place from the center of the galaxy, a starting point for the heros journey - from farmboy to the saviour of the galaxy.But for some twisted reason it's the center of this cinematic universe. At least the animated shows from filoni gave a sense of the vast comos, SW could be.Action/effects:
it's not that all effects/cgi looks bad, but there are way to often parts that look really cheap. Annd the action is just.. well, awkward to say the least.Conclusion:
there's no spirit, adventure, humour, design, story, acting.. anything that could make a good show.

tt13668894,ur70840572,4,11 February 2022,"I was a young boy when Empire Strikes Back was released and after that movie and Return, Boba Fett always held a certain mystery and that made him a cool character. Then when I was in my late teens/early 20's, I read 2 books of short stories which said Fett made it out of the Sarlacc Pit. That was also pretty cool - and it added to the character.Fett's return in Mando S2 worked really well for me - but this series did not. Going deeper on this man of mystery revealed a pretty dull character. The numerous flashbacks in Chapters 1 through 4 had some cool moments - but the pacing was way too slow.The actual present day story was very thin on the ground. At the end of Chapter 4, I thought ""Finally, the story is moving forward"". And then we got 2 Mando episodes. Now, they were good, but Fett wasn't even in Chapter 5 and so the main storyline stopped.That left Chapter 7, which seemed to be throw as much at it as possible - but was really a bit of a mess. At least the pacing was better.It moved Mando forward - but did this add to Boba Fett's character? Not really for me - indeed it may have even gone backwards. Fennec Shand was underused and what could have been a massive battle over Jabba's former empire, on various new worlds and over large territories - turned into a 50's/60's turf war on a small scale in one city even with the ""Mods"" thrown in.I also want to see a little more threat to key characters. Too many coming back from the dead doesn't leave you on the edge of your seat - and Fett and Mando's armour is another thing that doesn't help in that regard.There was too much looking back in this for me. Also, fan service is fine to a point - but when there's too much, it takes you out of the story and there was too much here. Also, too many nods to other movies/genres (The King Kong one in Chapter 7 for example), were too obvious and again take you out of the story.I do hope at some point, Star Wars will look to a time in the galaxy far, far away that's beyond the sequel trilogy and give us new adventures, characters and worlds.

The entire point was to give the fans the kind of Star Wars they remembered from their childhood, a sci-fi action/adventure/western and I'm totally there for it.Furthermore, I just have to say that Temuera Morrison just kills it as Boba Fett. His era of the iconic bounty hunter is just phenomenal. I keep hearing him termed naïve in most of the professional reviews as if it's a negative, but it's very much in line with his backstory. This version of the titular Fett isn't the spry lad from Clone Wars, nor is he the at his peak from the OGT, he an older, curmudgeonly warrior brought back from the edge of death, and it shows. He may have gotten softer in his old age, but then again, we all get there eventually... doesn't mean we have to lie down and take it.Here's hoping that if a second season is greenlit that it doesn't take too long, because I'd love to spend more time with these characters and their shenanigans.",2,5,/user/ur75365870/?ref_=tt_urv

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

tt13668894,ur8391872,2,22 January 2022,"I love Star Wars the Original Trilogy. I really liked the reboots as I saw it through the eyes of my kids and loved the CGI at work. The last three were ok, could have had much better story arcs rather than starting off with a rehash of A New Hope - those three were killed by whoever had overall controll of the Star Wars Universe Story at the time (did anyone - or did each director just add his thoughts and mess the whole thing up?).The offshoot movies were good, Rogue One and Solo were decent, but the public had been milked too far and were bored.The Obi Wan and Yoda movies died because of this one movie a year greed. They could have been great and more importantly had an audience eager to see them.Mandalorian was ok, a bit slow at times, but didn't have gimmicks, good CGI, nice story arc, decent acting.But...
This is just streaming fodder, so slow, no significant story or character development, just set pieces strung together with slitled dialogue (and very slitled sign language which the actors present with absolutely no conviction), and padded with Star Wars aliens and landscapes.I mean seriously, try and sum up the first two episodes' story using more than a couple of sentences apiece. You can't. There's that little story in them. It's like the story for this was done after hours whilst working on something more important.I really like much of Jon Favreau's work, but I honestly believe he's just run out of ideas for this, having done the mandalorian and having to do this must have been a nightmare, they're too similar in premise, character and origin to come up with anything original for the second.At least with Yoda and Obi he'd have a different story to tell, but they're saving those for the movies, so you just get dull, bland, uninformative, slow fodder to fill up Disney+ so there's something new to justify the subscription.EDIT:I've now watched episode 3 and 4...OMG, episode 3 was just awful. I almost gave up there and then. Didn't anyone in the committee running this realise that introducing the 60s mods power rangers on their coloured scooters would just antagonise anyone over the age of 8???Episode 4 is actually ok. Id rate it the best yet at about a 5. It's got character development, decent action sequences.And I now get what this is, they tried to hide it by not doing any story development in episode 1 and 2, but it's Star Wars gang wars. It's West Side Story, it's Sons of Anarchy in space, it's Quadraphenia (hence the mod space scooters). It's now so transparent. We've run out of original stories, let's just do gang wars on Tattoine. To be fair, it could be ok, get into it quicker without wasting two episodes, ditch the space mods on scooters and make it R rated. But they won't do that, they'll do the opposite to make it all Disney, Woke and appeal to as many children as possible.It's still got a chance to make me not hate it, but it'll need to improve in the sechalf of the season!Ok, now watched episode 3 and 4.OMG, episode 3 was a zero, absolutely awful, I mean anyone.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur8391872/?ref_=tt_urv

The worst part for me is the space Mods gang and their Vespas 🤣 just so cheesey and have no place in the star wars universe.

I do agree with others tho, i dont think they should have put them in here, but i love Luke so not going to argue. The rest of the series i found myself wanting to skip through it the whole time. The final sequence was a complete anticlimax too, yes the Ranchor scenes were fun, but Boba vs Bane was very lacklustre.I could watch the mandalorian over and over again, but I won't be watching this again, over than the Mando episodes.

tt13668894,ur95164145,3,10 February 2022,"The Book of Boba Fett started off watchable. Not great but watchable. The first few episodes are very slow and there are far too many flashbacks but they give the idea that the show is actually heading somewhere. It isn't though.Half way through, you get two episodes where Boba Fett disappears altogether, and you get season 2.5 of the Mandalorian instead. These episodes have nothing to do with the plot at all and I'm at a loss as to what the writers think this show is about. Yet somehow, these manage to be the best episodes of the series, even with the fact that Mando has gained a ship that means he now can't do his job as a bounty hunter.The last episode though is the final straw. It is an episode filled with entirely action, which makes it even more surprising that it is one of the most boring things I've ever seen. Everything happens at quarter speed. Fennec Shand takes an age to fall to the ground jumping from a metre up. Speeder bikes come steaming into the fray at 1mph. And people refuse to run. A mob of about 20 people fleeing a near-invincible giant death robot decide walk leisurely away whilst being shot at because it would be far too convenient if they just ran at the pace of a normal human being. And the cherry on top? The giant robot can't hit any of them despite the fact they're all bunched up and only ten feet away.And the acting in the last episode especially is awful, although this is probably more the writers' fault as the dialogue is just so stilted. Cad Bane is just about the only character that comes off as even remotely real, even though they he does look pretty weird. The weird robot biker gang are definitely the worst culprits.The best part of the last episode though is when one of the random robot guys decides to do a random 360 no scope, despite already having his gun drawn and pointed at the enemy. You've just got to laugh at whoever thought that was a good idea. It looks ridiculous.Overall, it started of watchable but the entire series is a waste of time. It's agonisingly slow in places, it doesn't have an interesting plot to speak of and the writing is just bad. Also the whole idea of Boba being a benevolent mob boss who doesn't sell drugs or threaten or hurt anybody who isn't already trying to kill him doesn't really work. He just came across as lazy and weak for most of the series.
