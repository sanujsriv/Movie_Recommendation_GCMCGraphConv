tt10223460,ur0438066,TxM,19 February 2022,"Jennifer Lopez is a singing star, Owen Wilson is a high school math teacher. Quite by accident they get married at a concert. Well, it wasn't a legal wedding but it set a few balls in motion.This movie is better than it should be, the writing is smart and all the actors do fine jobs in their roles. In some respects it reminds me of ""Notting Hill"" because a dull, ordinary, honest guy can't image that he could actually have a chance with a big star to build a life together.It also has many elements of a Hallmark movie, where two people are attracted, something gets in the way, then they have to figure out how to overcome obstacles.My wife and I watched it at home, streaming on Peacock.",23,31,/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv
tt10223460,ur50489624,9,16 February 2022,". . . recounts, in a legally veiled fashion, the sordid saga of pop star Brighten Swords. It skirts some of the potential litigation mine fields by transforming Ms. Swords into an orphan, with few if any siblings. This allows the MARRY ME filmmakers to replace Ms. Swords' parental conservator with a randomly selected husband. However, both the Real Life original dad and film avatar ""Cat's"" husband\guardian see their main function as curbing the out-of-control shenanigans of their wayward young women. Mirroring Reality, Cat is drawn up as a Three-Time Loser, whose first marriage lasted just 48 hours. Cat heaves rocks through picture windows to gain access to her mansions, and runs her blender with the top off. The actress portraying Cat courageously morphs herself into a disheveled disaster zone, with fake hair falling out here, there and everywhere, and handfuls of belly roll sloshing about on her undisciplined tummy. Whether on-stage or mixing with civilians, Cat's costumes display a total lack of good taste, proper decorum and situational awareness. Just as Ms. Theron won a Best Actress Oscar for becoming a fright in MONSTER, the lady acting out Cat\Brighten Swords deserves the gelded statuette even more so.",7,40,/user/ur50489624/?ref_=tt_urv
tt10223460,ur33907744,5,27 February 2022,"""Marry Me"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a music superstar getting married to a stranger during a live show and in front of a lot of fans, after she found out that her boyfriend has been unfaithful to her.I enjoyed this movie because it was simple and funny. It contained some cliché as all the romantic comedies but it was nice and it also combined very well comedy with romance. The direction which was made by Kat Coiro was good and she presented equally good both of her main characters, something that helped us understand them and follow them in the film. The interpretations of both Jennifer Lopez who played as Kat Valdez and Owen Wilson who played as Charlie were very good and their combination worked very well. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were John Bradley's who played as Colin and Sarah Silverman's who played as Parker. Lastly, I have to say that ""Marry Me"" is a nice, entertaining movie that I am sure it will make you laugh and have a great time so, I recommend you to watch it.",0,0,/user/ur33907744/?ref_=tt_urv
tt10223460,ur131783850,7,24 February 2022,"Marry Me (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in the movie theatre together. The storyline follows a famous pop singer about to get married when on the day of her public wedding she discovers her fiancé cheated on her. She decides to spontaneously marry a man in the audience instead. While seemingly improbable the pop star and every day school teacher to try to make their relationship work despite very different lifestyles.This movie is directed by Kat Coiro (She-Hulk) and stars Jennifer Lopez (U-Turn), Owen Wilson (Bottle Rocket), Sarah Silverman (School of Rock),
John Bradley (Game of Thrones) and Maluma (Encanto).The storyline for this is fairly straightforward but well modernized. Wilson and Lopez deliver strong and believable performances without being too cheesy and awkward. The comedic content is inconsistent but fun and the final few scenes do a good job of creating doubt and then triumph (as you'd expect in this genre).Overall this is a fun, feel good date movie that is worth a viewing. I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur131783850/?ref_=tt_urv
tt10223460,ur57691865,6,16 February 2022,3 out of 5 stars.Likes about the film. Marry Me is an entertaining romantic comedy film that delivers with two likable leads played by Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson. Lopez playing a pop star and Wilson playing a math teacher. Whose life gets turned upside down when a pop star asks him to marry her. When she discovered her fiance was having an affair with her assistant.Seeing the two characters go on a journey of learning about each other is fun. Wilson trying to reconnect with his daughter. Lopez never actually living an independent life when she relies on everyone.It does have some fun humor. And moves at a brisk pace.Dislikes is the film can be predictable. Lopez ex comes back into the picture. Trying to reconsider there break up. While Wilson feeling left out with that lifestyle. We can predict how the story goes from there with these rom com films.The writing can be cheesy with its dialogue and the pop star music does feel odd and forced.,unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur57691865/?ref_=tt_urv

That's a problem!What we have here is Jennifer Lopez desperately trying to look young and hip again, while she looks really old and (let's face it) she really has become a has been.Once she was popular, hot and happening.Now she is NOT.This story is so incredibly stupid and unbelievable that no one would buy into it, unless you have had serious brain injury by listening to too many Jennifer Lopez songs....",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur84924605/?ref_=tt_urv

However when her fiance cheats on her,Kat is left devasted and spots Charlie Gilbert(Wilson) with his friend (Silvermann) and his daughter with a sign saying Marry Me to which Kat agrees on. But will romance blossom between Kat the singing sensation and maths teacher who also happens to be be dad of one Charlie?Overall I was surprised by this film. Yes it's predictable as I knew how the film will end but I liked it. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Lopez (their second collab together as they were in Anaconda together back in 1997) were great. The songs were nice and I liked the story.If you loved Notting Hill,Maid In Manhattan(especially Notting Hill) you'll love this.",40,59,/user/ur23566468/?ref_=tt_urv

Not much new, as far as plots go-if you've seen Notting Hill, you know the plot-but it's done in an enjoyable manner, if you want to take a date to the movies. Jennifer plays a music superstar-I know, a big stretch-that is part of a duo that have a hit single called Marry Me. Jennifer finds out he is cheating on her minutes before going on stage and has a meltdown. She looks out into the audience and sees Owen holding a sign saying Marry Me and Jennifer points to him and says she will marry him, instead. Owen is a math teacher that took his daughter to the concert and doesn't even know how popular Jennifer is-he was holding the sign for a friend, remember?-and does not even participate on social media. John plays Jennifer's manager, Sarah plays Owen's co_worker and Chloe plays Owen's daughter. Jennifer has been in several relationships that didn't work out-no, this is not an autobiography of her real life-and has to decide whether to stick it out with her cheating, singing partner or go for the down to earth math teacher.

tt10223460,ur25226117,8,13 February 2022,"LIKES:Pace:
-Marry Me is one of those movies that is all about getting the drama and adventure started in little time and jumps right into the quick intro.-The titular moment happens early, happens close to the trailer, and sets the stage for the rest of the movie, not taking too long to open the gates for adventures
-A fun pace continues for most of the movie, briskly to get to the next fun adventure, but still allowing time for the two characters to bond in new ways
-Keeps a nice entertaining pace until the very end of the movie, meaning more entertainment and relaxing.The Charm and Cuteness:
-This movie is all about the cute factor that arises with the new relationship, and helps brighten up the theater or room you are watching it in.-It makes you feel happy, and offers that spark of hope and joy that seems to be needed during the modern era.-Family friendly for much of the movie due to this, with little cursing or semantics to overtake the story, again leading to enjoyable for groups and dates.-That charm factor does manage to break it out of the pure romance mode, a very strong factor to bring more audience in.-Brings elements of other movies to make the movie fun like a Kindergarten Cop element, with Wedding Planner, and a little You've Got Mail.Funny:
-Not the wettest comedy, but has some good zings to chuckle and laugh at without breaking the limit.-The Dog in particular is a funny prop, that does little, but works the camera well in the jokes
-A little diversity to help keep things fresh, but never deviates to far from the baseline to be forced or off the wall, again a smart move to keep with the theme.-Sticks to the charm of the movie and is not going to be too ugly or disgusting to offset the mood.The Acting:
-Jennifer Lopez is stylish, chic and returns to the roots we loved with Wedding Planner and Monster in Law. Those qualities don't come at the expense of strength, but rather play nicely with it to make a more representable and likeable character
-Owen Wilson's nature of low key, depressed energy manages to handle the high energy of Lopez, and brings that loveable goofy relationship that somehow is inspiring and enjoyable to see.-Maluma is okay, his strength comes in singing (talked later), but plays his role as the cad quite well in the limited time he has to act
-The Victory comes in the chemistry of the leads and how well they play off of each other to craft a believable relationship that has time and attention to details.-It's that chemistry that drives a lot of the fun, brings other characters into the moment to have relevance, and elevate their own characters as a result.-Not Oscar worthy at all, but again, fun and fitting for the nature of the movie.The Style:
-This is mainly a J-Lo category, but I nod to the talent of dress and costume designers in their ability to make these outfits come to life.-Marry Me has some importance on fashion, and uses it to express the mood, while also reflecting the demands of the job on profile as well.-It will make people envious, because the clothes may be curtailed, but are really fashionable and easy to mimic in the future like Hustlers. They flow, they tell a story and dang are they beautiful at times.The Music:
-My favorite part after the cute fun, Marry Me's music is a centerpiece of excellence for the movie song category.-Part of the songs are just there to get your toe tapping and promote the soundtrack for you to buy, but the pop motions are fun, and go well with the scenes they are promoted over
-The second set of songs hold the motion and stronger storytelling, representing the emotion and progression of the character in the face of the challenge. These songs are more about the beauty and the heart than anything else.-All songs though are very fitting, and even Maluma has a couple of songs that harmonize with the other parts of the songs, and has its own charm.DISLIKES:A Bit Cheesy at Times:
-They are present in many movies, but the movie sometimes does dip into the cheesy moment to get another song in.-The dialogue at these parts loses the charm and natural flow, dipping into the forced writing that gets quoted by many, but does not offer the deepest connection.Some Characters Requiring More Time:
-Though they were elevated by the main two, they still need more time to give you more of their development and meaningful involvement.-A pop star and a commoner together offer some creativity to really exploit and have fun with, but sadly is not done to the full potential leading to generic adventures
-More character development needed, including the antagonist who is a very simplistic tool to get the two leads together, but offers little obstruction to the progression of the story.-With some other big names and set up plot points, there was more to dive into, but sadly did not happen and that was a bit limiting in the grand scheme of things.-Even the leads needed some more time to get the full effects and deals, but fortunately the other factors help mitigate the shallower characters.Predictable:
-The movie's predictability is extraordinary, with few twists or turns on profile to spice things up or help get a few wow factors back into the movie.-If we had better character involvement and some fun adventures, the predictability would be lessened further, and would have helped make this movie feel a little less like a Hallmark movie.-Not the weakest dislike, but still something that could have helped elevate the movie by mitigating the predictability.-The end credits I expected, but did little to entertain or add hope, and again was a bit cheesy at this time.The VERDICT:Marry Me is surprisingly a very fun film that really lift the spirits for all during these tough times. It's fun, and moves at that pace that is entertaining and nontraditional for most of the romantic comedy genre films. The acting is great for the role, really elevating the fun they are having, while also helping to expand on the secondary characters, with a chemistry that you think wont' work, but really does. Throw in fun settings, clothes that again enhance the characters, while also looking good, and you establishing a charming movie that is again fun in its simplicity. With a music to provide solid storytelling as well, the movie again accomplishes the goals of a J-Lo led film. Yet, the movie needs more time, or more focus on the fun and character usage to help overshadow the predictable plot. This factor is what I would have maximized, and provided the fun element the most focus to really maximize the wonderful buddy comedy that Marry Me was. I saw this at home, but it really is the movie of the weekend for me, as there is diversity for many groups to go to, or to go solo if you are like me.Thus, my scores are:Comedy/Music/Romance: 7.5 -8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv

However, I agree, if you can't get past the bizarre scenarios and ridiculous plot then you may conclude this is the turkey of all turkeys!Why so did I like it, you may well ask, why did this old hack like it, well the on screen chemistry between this odd couple, Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson worked in spades, it was charming, believable, sweet, and it all just breathed in all the right places. These two were perfectly cast and the roles they took were right up their street.How interesting that John Bradley featured in both Moonfall and Marry Me, and they had a similar endearing charm and were both idiotically far fetched!I'm giving this a firm 7 out of 10 for total charm, and escapist entertainment.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur12048299/?ref_=tt_urv

tt10223460,ur14630819,3,12 February 2022,"The plot for this is silly but workable and takes a swipe at the manufactured state of modern life in the spotlight.Ironically this film suffers from the aliments it pokes fun at.The garish product placement, the awkward tokenism, the forced one-liners, promotional music videos, and relentless social commentary drains the warmth from this movie, making it feel contrived in a very clinic way.The characters feel like they rolled off the Role-model Factory: safe, sterile and dull. I didn't care about them at all.Both are self-sufficient individuals who don't need each other beyond the superficial - one is happy in her ivory tower of wealth the other content in his smug self-righteousness - so they might as well go their own ways.Jennifer's character is always in complete control of every situation, she always looks flawless and is propped up by immense material resources allowing herself to buy her way out of any situation, any issue she has is really only a minor inconvenience that will pass - making her hard to relate to.Owen Wilson plays himself as usual, his character is very plain, which is ok. But again he has everything he ever wanted, apart from his daughter's admiration, which is quite easily purchased.Whereas Julia Roberts was - just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her.Jennifer Lopez is - just a woman, working in an industry that marginalises women, asking a man to rewrite a patriarchal narrative so she can show her social media audience she is strong and independent.Whether you agree with that sentiment or not is one thing, but it certainly isn't romantic or comedic.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur14630819/?ref_=tt_urv
tt10223460,ur130195767,7,14 February 2022,"Whether you enjoy this movie or not depends mostly on how much you tolerate this type of romcom. It's a cheesy romance where two people fell in love, then some conflict happened that broke them up, and then they remembered their past moments and finally they made up and became happy forever.Well I call this genre my guilty pleasure, so I had a fun time with Marry Me. J-Lo and Owen Wilson had good chemistry. Wilson was great as the conserved teacher who was pulled into the fame game. These two was definitely the biggest reason that this cheese fest wasn't bad.I didn't like how little screen time the daughter character had. The emotion could have been elevated more if they involved the daughter with J-Lo and Wilson's characters.Overall, if you don't mind cheesy romcom, Marry Me will be an easy and fun time for this year's Valentine's Day.

tt10223460,ur60227834,8,16 February 2022,"This was a sugar sweet romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson as the romantic leads. Owen Wilson plays Charlie a divorced single dad whose daughter Lou is attending the school that he teaches at. Jennifer Lopez plays a mega pop star, Kat Valdez, whose life is being lived out in front of her fans on social media. Right Before she steps out on stage to marry her 4th (?) husband and current boyfriend/pop star Bastian (played by real-life Latin pop sensation Maluma), she finds out that he cheated on her with one of her assistants. On stage in front of millions she decides to make a different choice and calls up Charlie who is in the audience holding his friend's sign ""marry me""...and then she marries him right on stage.These two couldn't be more unalike! But they take the time to get to know one another before just walking away.This film is so filled with social media, advertisements for everything from Coach to Vitamix blenders (although I love my Vitamix and would never part with it!), and music (I assume from the soundtrack) that you are never bored. So, it doesn't suffer from the usual romantic comedy slump...additionally Jennifer Lopez and Maluma are so gorgeous there is a lot of eye candy for everyone...and then the comedy is not just being brought to you by the amazing Owen Wilson but by Sarah Silverman (who keeps it surprisingly clean) as his best friend.There is a small bit of awkwardness in the form of game of thrones famous, John Bradley, who does great except for in this scene where he is supposed to comfort his client Kat.

tt10223460,ur23240045,7,23 February 2022,"Romantic Comedies are almost exclusively streaming these days. Whether it's a television series or a film, they're almost always dropped on services like Netflix or Prime Video. When I heard Jennifer Lopez would be headlining yet another one and that it would be coming to theatres, I questioned (unfairly) the fact that fantastic ones end up being unseen or forgotten in streaming. Well, I was very wrong in assuming it was just another throwaway Romantic Comedy because Marry Me was a pleasant surprise. Yes, the story plays out exactly how you think it will, but it's the fact that it feels like it has the harmless charm of a movie that was made 20 years ago that sold me.Kat (Jennifer Lopez) and Bastian (Maluma) are both pop stars and are about to get married. During one of Kat's shows, their plan was to exchange vows. Finding out that he has recently cheated on her, she decides to make a crazy decision. She points to a man in the crowd who's holding a sign that says ""Marry Me"" and she responds by saying, ""Why Not?"". This man, Charlie (Owen Wilson) a recently single father who is trying to add some fun to his daughter's life, goes along with it. These two lead very different lives, but it may just end up being what both of them needed.I'll start by saying that I never thought I'd see a romantic bond between Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson on-screen in my lifetime, but it really worked. This film has all the cheese and silly one-liners that you'd expect from a movie in the early-2000s and that's why I enjoyed it. Not only does it feel like it's from a different time, but the third act also flips the classic cliches on their head and I thought it was a nice change of pace. There are story choices that are predictable from the moment the movie starts, but at this point, every romantic comedy is predictable. This film embraces all of these elements and elevates them.Jennifer Lopez was enjoyable in this but I really latched onto Owen Wilson's performance here. I thought the way he played being a nobody who became a somebody overnight was very well-acted. Is this film going to win any awards? Absolutely not, but it's still an enjoyable romance story that we don't get enough of these days. I can't see many people ripping this one apart. It knew what it wanted to be and it delivered just that. This is the first mainstream romantic comedy in a long time that I'd gladly watch again on a rainy day.

John Bradley (Game of Thrones) and Sarah Silverman (Ralph Breaks the Internet) also contribute to the light and fun environment of the film.The balance between the life of a celebrity and the ""common citizen"" is quite well explored, and the vision of how much fame limits a normal life is the most interesting storyline of the entire narrative.For fans of the genre, it's strongly recommended.""Rating: B.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur79118814/?ref_=tt_urv

tt10223460,ur34790048,4,10 February 2022,"Marry Me is a new romantic comedy directed by Kat Coiro. This is her comeback as a film director since 2013, as since 2013, she has directed more short films and several TV episode of various shows.The film is about popular singer Kat Valdez (Jennifer Lopez), who, together with her singing partner Bastian (Maluma), are about to release their new album Marry Me and then get married themselves. When Kat learns that Bastian has cheated on her, she cancels the wedding plan and concert. She then sees Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) in the audience with a sign that says Marry Me and decides to spontaneously marry him during her show. This is how the lives of both Kat and Charlie change. Kat now seems a bit desperate by marrying a total stranger, while Charlie suddenly finds himself in the publicity he is not used to at all. The two are just trying to make the best of it together, but now have to go through the publicity and criticism of the news and social media.For a romantic comedy, this film initially comes across as two separate stories of Kat and Charlie, who occasionally come together for a press conference or an interview. In Kat's story she just tries to lead a star life and to work around the criticism of others. In Charlie's story, he then tries to improve the bond between him and his daughter. In the second half of the film, the two really come together more, but seem more like friends challenging each other to things than they really seem like a newlywed couple. The film does not come across as a romantic film and it remains more of a comedy. The story is also somewhat familiar and has some predictable or more unbelievable sides. Thus, only a few of the comedic moments in the film work, while the rest seem more impractical.The acting in the film is well done, but otherwise not really special. Jennifer Lopez pretty much plays herself as a popular pop star going through a rough patch. Furthermore, she tries to remain in a good light for her fans and the press. In addition, in addition to the film, she also seems to promote the accompanying music album and also tries to sell it in addition to the film. The film often shows how she prepares for a concert and then you get to see a performance. Afterwards you get to see how she works on her song before she releases it or uses it in a performance. If they hadn't brought this up in the film in this way and just used the songs as a soundtrack, the film could have been shorter running and a little less tedious. In addition to the film, Kat Coiro has also directed music clips of songs from this film. They both seem to be trying to earn a little extra with this. For Maluma, this is his first acting job in a movie, but he's really just playing a famous singer just like he has done in his music career for the movie. That way he doesn't really get the chance to come forward as an actor.Owen Wilson comes across as an awkward man, who is used to a more quiet life and doesn't like popularity and social media, but now has to learn to deal with this. He also comes across well with Chloe Coleman as father and daughter who have become somewhat estranged from each other, but are trying to adjust. Sarah Silverman likes to play a colleague of Owen Wilson's character, who helps him understand social media, but also takes advantage of his popularity himself.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur34790048/?ref_=tt_urv

tt10223460,ur59184301,10,12 February 2022,"""If you focus on the steps you'll forget how scared you are"" If you sit on the question long enough the answer will find you"".What's the difference between the new Jennifer Lopez rom-com ""Marry Me"" and a heart-shaped box of valentine chocolates? As Forrest Gump reminded us, in a box of chocolates you never know what you're going to bite into, and in ""Marry Me"" you know exactly what you're going to get. But hey, it's still a box of chocolates. What you're going to get may not be very nourishing but it is going to taste very, very good. Kat's latest hit is called ""Marry Me,"" a duet with her fiancé, Bastian (Colombian singer Maluma). They have announced that they will top off her ""Marry Me"" concert tour by having their wedding on stage and streaming, with an expected audience of 20 million. Seconds before the ceremony she learns that Bastian has been unfaithful. Yes, the script might as well have been written by an algorithm to hit every rom-com beat, from the meet-cute to the magical connection to the setback to the happy ending, but it deserves extra credit for what it avoids. There are no silly misunderstandings, contrived situations, or cartoonishly awful people. Even the one character whose trash talk at a school competition goes too far gets a happy ending. And the ""When Harry Met Sally""-style clips over the credits with couples telling their stories make the possibility of happy endings for all of us seem a little closer. Love is about sacrifice and the day-to-day, You can't marry a dream, you can only marry who you love. ""I'm told that twenty million people are supposed to watch me sing Marry Me to the love of my life, and then watch as we take our vows. So it's only natural that I would want to see who I'm talking to. Only natural that I say something, if not about marriage, then about love. Because that's what we're all looking for, right? Love? We get so caught up in what we want our life to be that we forget what our love actually is. A lie. A fairy tale that you sold yourself so long ago that you forgot that wasn't real. But deep down, you knew. Somehow you knew. You realize that it wasn't love at all. You werejust in love with the idea of who you wanted that person to be. But you can't marry an idea.""

tt10223460,ur49237919,9,18 February 2022,"I always read through reviews and the ones for this film worry me, questioning the realism or likeliness of the plot and making derogatory comments about the appearances of both leads, or questioning John Bradley's casting based on appearance, isn't acceptance the big thing right now? I mean first the nastiness and anger is bad enough but the fact people don't suspend their disbelief at films anymore is sad. They're not always going to be realistic, a lot of great Rom cons aren't, late nineties- early noughties had so many classic ones that were completely ludicrous but equally brilliant.Yes the plot is far fetched and a bit unrealistic however with how the world is going I actually don't think it's impossible, the vain, air headed world of social media has made the world such a worse place that it's not out of the realm of possibility that the pressure it causes could lead to a strange moment like this.J-Lo is nearly 54 and I don't care what anyone says she looked fantastic in this, Yes it's easier to look better with money and top people but you still have to make the effort. I wasn't a huge fan of her music or older films but I loved her in this, surprisingly natural and really just sweet. She was naive like a teen, people think when your older you instantly know more or feel differently but you feel the same as 21.John Bradley for me is a great cast here, after being a great co-lead in moonfall I really enjoyed him here, there's a tired cliche of what managers are and portrayed as. I am a big fan of going against cliche. He was warm, sweet and honest and the relationship with JLo felt natural, friendly and kind, which is a nice change from evil money hungry managers of the past, I don't care about his appearance or style, I thought he was brilliant in this, their chemistry felt real.Then for Owen Wilson, when I was younger I was a huge fan, as I watched more I did start to find him one dimensional, not bad, but he started mixing up roles and styles and I respect that, done some things I'd not expect and done them well. He's not an unattractive guy, he has one obvious feature that people obsess with, however he wasn't designed to be a heart throb in this, it was a normal guy in a crowd of thousands, if it'd have been a stunning ripped actor, for me that'd have ruined the concept of the randomness. I thought their chemistry was great and although cheesy it worked well.It was totally enjoyable, the young girl was great as she has been in everything I've seen, especially the spy film with Batista. People seem nostalgic for old rom coms that were silly, fun and charming yet they don't like it when it happens! Another curse of social media, fake nostalgia, like those young kids rocking guns n roses or smiths t shirts.It's a classic Rom com, if you don't like certain plots, maybe watch a trailer? They're pretty clear on who's in it and what it's about, unsure how people are still surprised.

But not illustrated like this of course.One of the admirable things about this film is that it embraces its silliness. Which of course is great screenwriting. Embracing silliness doesn't make a movie bad. This film is basically saying: ""A mega superstar just picked a random guy and married him without even getting his name."" They illustrate how silly this can be by the funny Instagram posts and the Marriage Officiant when he says: ""Do you? Some guy?!"" lol.Here's another thing: The movie illustrates how different the leads lives are, and what would happen if you mesh them together. Being a celebrity is a taxing job. People are always knowing your business and eager to learn more about you. With Owen Wilson's character it was the opposite. He wasn't that well known until he married Kat.Besides the fact that this was based on a webcomic (which I have yet to read). The movie is predictable. But it's admirable for how realistic it can be at times and how it highlights the differences between the two protagonists and plays out the humor.

I think Owen Wilson is actually under appreciated, at least to me, as he is able to play the common man so well. He's not flashy and seems so humble in the film.

She plays Kat Valdez, a hugely successful pop star who's had three unsuccessful marriages and is about to embark on an ill-advised fourth with a much younger, suave hunk Latin pop singer (Maluma)-until she learns, just prior to walking down the aisle, that he's cheating on her. On the rebound at her fully live-streamed concert slash mega-wedding, she marries a nerdy, divorced math teacher (Owen Wilson) in the audience instead.Of course, the very mismatched duo connect and fall for each other, because this is a J-Lo rom com!However, ""Marry Me"" has a very contrived plot and writing that seems to borrow too obviously from much better rom coms of the past, like ""Notting Hill."" There's too little comedy (which is in short supply these days anyway), and this may have played better as a romance without trying to be funny. What I liked was seeing two actors of around 50 paired in a midlife romance, both overcoming their past heartbreaks, relationship mistakes, and fears. Both characters are so nice and giving to each other, but they're both afraid of failure at love. Would have been a nice drama/romance with less glitz, perhaps. Lopez plays her character-which is basically herself-with some vulnerability and pathos. She admits that her first quickie marriage was a mistake, that she is very image-conscious, etc. She doesn't hide her desire to try again even if the public & media crack mean jokes about her. All very much like her real life. Brava, Jennifer!""Marry Me"" suffers from a poor story and trite writing, and too much reliance on social media as a gimmick.

tt10223460,ur0527718,9,21 February 2022,"In a time when it would seem the Rom-Com is all but dead, it has been refreshing to see some fledgling attempts at a triumphant return. The 1990s as well as the early 2000s were highlighted by many heartwarming romantic comedies that you couldn't help but love: Pretty Woman (1990), Notting Hill (1999), While You Were Sleeping (1995), Ever After (1998), Return To Me (2000), and The Wedding Planner (2001), to name a few. This film, however, seeks to reinvent the genre, offering a rare, insider look at the daily life of a global star that provides a greater understanding of their struggles, as well as highlighting the importance of humility and balance in an industry plagued by the lack of it.Based on the graphic novel written by Bobby Crosby, Marry Me (2022) follows music superstars Kat Valdez (Lopez) and Bastian (Maluma) as they prepare to get married on stage in front of thousands of fans during a global live-stream. When Kat learns that her soon-to-be husband was unfaithful mere seconds before she is to take her vows in front of the world, she decides to marry a random guy holding a 'Marry Me' sign instead, much to the shock and disappointment of all her fans, staff, and the world. Despite being from completely different worlds, they spend the next few months getting to know each other, and find they are not as different as the world would have them believe.Screenwriters John Rogers, Tami Sagher, and Harper Dill did a marvelous job updating the source material from Crosby to offer something deeper that allows the main characters more growth and understanding. It is intriguing in that it follows the standard formula, and yet defies the typical tropes at every turn. It has always been perplexing that the great majority of people subscribe to the misguided notion that two people are doomed to fail in a relationship (or friendship) if they are too different, however the opposite more often than not proves true. Differences offer more opportunities for introspection, tolerance, and personal growth, which in turn makes for a stronger foundation. The willingness and ability to adapt and compromise is usually born out of mutual respect and love, and ultimately will be the determining factor as to whether or not the relationship will last. These themes are explored and analyzed quite astutely, and enjoyably. While on paper, it would seem Lopez and Wilson would not play well together, here is a quintessential example of art imitating life, making the pair perfect for these roles. And it is their acting talents that allows them to succeed in pulling the story off, particularly Lopez.With J. Lo getting her start as a back-up dancer on ""In Living Color"", it seems that movie critics will just never give her a fair shake. She may not be 'classically trained', however there is no denying that she possesses a certain rare talent for conveying emotion and depth, regardless of the performance. The film that brought her squarely into the limelight proved that in spades-Selena (1997). Here, she draws on something deep in her soul, allowing for such a beautiful and seemingly effortless performance. She is in line with Sandra Bullock and Angelina Jolie in that regard, however she never seems to be critiqued fairly. True, she has chosen some bad projects, but her acting ability never faltered.In some ways, the film is an expose that offers understanding to both the characters-two people from different walks of life that live in two very different worlds-as well as to the audience. It offers an important commentary on the difference between reality and what appears in the news and on social media, as well as astutely grounding the idea of celebrities, showcasing how they are still real people with very real fears and desires. And while fame requires them to have what some would contend is an unnatural lifestyle, they can still make certain choices to ground themselves. Nothing is frivolous here-scenes were carefully chosen to juxtapose their polar opposite lifestyles, as well as allow the audience to understand how the insanity of fame must necessarily become normal-otherwise even the sanest person would go crazy, which could perhaps account for some very public breakdowns of certain celebrities. It is not all glamor and wealth-there is immense pressure, negativity, and fear that can encapsulate their lives. Not everyone is cut out for it, and without walking a mile in their shoes, few can understand it. Accepting the publicity and the complete lack of privacy as the status quo becomes necessary to survive in the industry, having to make your every waking decision with consideration of how it will appear or what the narrative may spin into, and how it will potentially affect their livelihood.Owen Wilson was quite adept at portraying the average Joe working man-a middle school math teacher-having an active role in his daughter's life, struggling to feel he measures up to the cool stepdad, which is also a departure from the usual stepfather-is-the-devil trope. Not only is Wilson believable, but he manages to cultivate some natural chemistry with Lopez that was comparable to even McConaughey opposite Lopez in The Wedding Planner (2001)-arguably her best rom-com to date-until now that is. All of the little moments they share, with her seeking to get to know him, and growing to care about what he cares about, slowly opening her heart to him felt real and authentic. The most emotional moment was when Kat surprises Charlie for his birthday, accurately showing what true love really is. The supporting cast was also enjoyable-even Sarah Silverman, who is usually quite detestable, was comedic and entertaining. Chloe Coleman as Charlie's teenage daughter Lou was captivating. John Bradley as Kat's manager brought an honesty to his character. It was refreshing to see that he genuinely cared for her happiness above all else.This could have been a very by-the-numbers, skim the surface type of film, however the writers boldly chose to use it as an opportunity to explore the stark reality behind celebrity life-that it is not all excessive shopping, exclusive movie premieres, and trips around the world on private jets-and apparently Lopez had a hand in crafting realistic moments. The music was thoroughly enjoyable, with Jennifer providing one of the songs for the soundtrack that may be one of her best to date, entitled ""After Love, Pt. 1"". The last song she is inspired to write toward the end, ""On My Way"", was also moving. There was unfortunately a number that one can only hope was intended as comical that came off quite inappropriate and somewhat offensive to even the most liberal viewer-her opening song ""Church"", which even the non-religious will balk at, though it could also be seen as a contrast from the past to how Charlie has affected her. But that honestly was really the only questionable moment of the film. Sure, there could have been more angst and drama leading to their eventual separation, and a better reunion scene, however it somehow felt true and real, not seeking to stamp out that over-the-top romantic overture scene that its counterparts would ascribe to. In that way, it stands out in the crowd, refusing to relegate itself to merely being the traditional, run-of-the-mill rom-com.Another aspect that separates this film from the rest is that it touches on how unfair the industry is for females-musicians and actors alike-once they pass age forty, as well as the judgment and stigma that comes with celebrity marriages and divorces, with the expectation and pressure that always precedes and follows. This film smartly shines a light on all of these double standards that are not merely for the sake of the narrative, but very real issues that many celebrities-including Lopez-have experienced in real life. Many have accused the film of being nothing more than Lopez's own ego at work, a convenient medium for self-promotion and album sales. Not only does it not play as such, but they are missing the glaringly obvious point that she does not need it. Furthermore, it is about so much more than that. Unfortunately, most are missing the plot quite literally. It's high time for the critics to give credit where credit is due. Lopez deserves all the accolades, and then some. She deserves an Oscar and a Grammy for her efforts here.For all of these reasons and more, this film is a cut above the cloth, and affected this reviewer in unexpected ways. I was smiling from ear to ear almost the entire film... I have not felt such joy or inspiration from a film in such a long time. Everyone may not share this experience, but you at least owe it to yourself to go in with an open mind and an understanding that this is not your stereotypical Rom-Com. Also, I whole-heartedly agree with Charlie-""After Love"" is my new favorite song too.FINAL VERDICT: Surprisingly heartfelt and uplifting. It is deeper and more introspective than it is being given credit for. I implore you to give it a chance, and go in attempting to be objective. Just take it in with an open mind and heart, and see how it moves you, for it certainly moved me.ALTERNATE RECOMMENDATIONS: None--go see it *in theaters*.~AleXa~ An original IMDB user for over 20 years.

*SPOILERS*The movie is obviously about a famous singer who gets cheated on marries a random fan in the crowd instead. There was no real conflict in the movie. From Jennifer Lopez's side, her character made you believe she actually fell in love with owen's character but I didn't feel the same about Owen. I don't know if it's because his character was a cynic by design but he gave up way too early. Jennifer's character was on tour a lot of the movie and very quickly his character decided 'he didn't fit' without even really trying. They hardly spent any time together, whether it was because her annoying ex kept showing up or her entourage always interrupted. Even so, they showed Jennifer's character fall for him.

It has to involve sane, rational people making justifiable decisions. I'll admit ""movie"" people make crazy decisions, especially in horror movies where they stick their heads into alien pods to get a closer look. But this movie's initiating action is so bizarrely forced that it's impossible for me to believe anybody could buy in. If I described it, you'd laugh out loud. Sure, in romcoms people ""meet cute."" Strange things bring them together only to be temporarily separated by the 3rd act reversal. I get it. But the meet scene just doesn't work on any level. It's in the script but it's not on the pages. There is no ""there"" there. The rest of it is stale JLo song and dance. If you a big fan of hers, you'll get a kick out of it although you've seen it all before. Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson. He and JLo have zero chemistry. Zero. But, on the positive side we get lots of progressivism (I'll refrain from woke). Check marks for all the tropes. So if you like to see that kind of thing, this one's for you. Doesn't fit the script but the script was written with a few goals, one of which was 21st century social progress. And yes, we have lots of other social media tropes as well. Again, if that's you thing, you'll like it. I read some reviews before we saw it. Quite a few were positive.

tt10223460,ur141983543,9,16 February 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS & COULD'VE BEEN BETTER:Highlights: Well outside of Tank (LOL awwwww), and despite the moments of awkwardness, I did like the ""charming-duo"" of Owen and Jennifer. They were very likable characters to watch and follow.Could've Been Better: The character development for Kat lacked. There were decisions made with her as a celebrity and as a person that felt random in order to add emotional &/or cute plot interactions with and between Kat and Charlie that I guess for the sake of a ""rom-com"" could be glossed over, but nah... I can't let it slide. I think that would've added just a little more depth to the chemistry to the story.OTHER THOUGHTS:TAKEAWAYS:1. This was a pretty long love story, I must admit. I really didn't feel the nearly 120 minutes, but I definitely recognized the pivot to the second hour. But for the most part, the film utilizes its cuteness well with the pacing. Nothing felt too rushed story wise, but maybe a little rushed in terms of theme and character continuity.2. Every comment Michelle's character made about Owen's character... I was thinking the same thing LOL LOL3. Baby, Listen... Maluma! UGH! #Swoon4. Alright for Charlie into the chocolate LOL5. Seeing Jennifer and Owen together fluctuated between cute chemistry and awkwardness, but I also admittedly wonder if that had to do with: a. The fact that I don't particularly find Owen Wilson attractive, b. That it was him vs Maluma (ol' fine ass), c. When compared to Jennifer's list of yt male love interests in films...he's the odd one, & d. When compared to Jennifer's actually real life marriages...he's the odd one...AAAND / BUT... this also worked in the favor of character interest. I'll say more about this in my quick though on the plot, but hearing other key characters make comments that were exactly what I was thinking about our main characters made me invest in them because I wasn't alone in my feelings (LOL). So in terms of likability, it was a win.HOWEVER... I do wish the film would've utilized the opening credit scenes in a fun way to actually lay some groundwork for not only Kat as a celebrity, but also Kat's failed relationship past since it was a big part of her character development vs using so much dialogue and background noise to fill in the blanks across the film.The first thought that comes to mind is how the movie Now and Then starts (I believe) where there's a track playing, and the screen shows a series of pictures of the girls overtime growing into themselves. In this case, the film could've had a series of marriage photos then tabloids about the failures leading up to the current one with Bastian before fading into the present where we see Kat walking past a tv screen of news covering the main event of Act One-preparing for the Kat and Bastian's concert where they will sing their hot new duet before tying the knot...6. The low-key standout was Tank. LOL7. I will say... JLo was SIIIIIINGING on that On My Way track.8. Come Thru PEORIA (My hometown LOL).9. The strongest message to come across for me is, ""Sometimes we can find real love if we take a detour off the path we normally follow."" Act One makes this clear via the happenings in Kat's life and her moment on stage. Though I still think more could've been done in Act One to really showcase the need for a detour.Act Two is where space is made for these characters to cruise in the detour and really get to know one another and assess what the relationship is/could be.Act Three gives a pretty predictable tension, but ultimately comes full circle with the message.10. Marry Me tells the story of a superstar who seemingly has bad luck finding and holding on to love deciding to commit to a spontaneous (and almost rebound-ish) choice-moment, fueled by hurt and disappointment, marrying a thought-to-be fan at her concert.Act One doesn't do the best job of giving us a background to Kat to fully support the theme, even though the written idea of Kat definitely gave more than just looks, entertainment, and marriage. And though I appreciated the balance of learning about both main characters, I think more time taken away from Charlie in order to give a sense of the woman he would eventually find himself unexpectedly ""marrying"" would've been a more interesting move. The moment that stands out because it feels so odd (though cute) was in the second hour when Charlie gives Kat ""a challenge..."" So you mean to tell me she really was that ""lost/confused?"" If so, then why? Use Act One to show this aspect to Kat's character. I did enjoy Charlie's moments in Act One, though. They were very charming which at least gave audiences an idea of what Kat could expect by taking the detour.Act Two is the cutest of the Acts, and the strongest theme connection because it focuses on seeing our ""arrangement"" really enjoy one another. It was also awkward at times because of point #5, but that was just me... LOLAct Three closes the story out well with the theme in more ways that one-dialogue, character perspective, and even the setting. It also does a good job with giving Kat some conflicting tension... although, there was something a little off about how Kat's ""motivations"" and ""interests"" seemed to shift so fast with an opportunity, which is why I feel more space should've been given to Kat's superstardom background in Act One.* * *
Overall #MarryMe gives Empire meets - the early courting and media frenzy of Prince Charles and Princess Diana meets - the journal of Jennifer Lopez's life - meets Notting HillI will say, I smiled for most of the movie, and I appreciated how this film seemed to poke jabs at both stars-JLo and her track record of relationships in this industry, and the mixed feelings about Owen's attractiveness.

Some light heart comic scenes.

Advertising. Now that people are able to block adverts through AdBlocks, we're getting advertisements right in the movies.

tt10223460,ur61151364,9,20 February 2022,"I went in thinking that it was going to be incredibly hard to watch but it was actually so heartwarming and kind of relatable. Well, as relatable as it can be when the movie is about a Popstar.Charlie and Kat live completely different lives but they meet at Kat's concert where she's supposed to marry her fiancé in front of their fans. Charlie is persuaded to go to the concert by his friend Parker. She forces him to hold onto a sign saying ""marry me"" as Kat appears on stage.She has just seen a video of her fiancé cheating on her with her assistant and stops the music to make a short speech about loving the idea of someone, which Charlie is seen listening with a mirrored expression of heartbreak. In this moment, Kat impulsively says yes and points to Charlie holding the ""marry me"" sign. Parker and Lou, Charlie's daughter, push him to walk to the stage and he says okay to marrying Kat.The heartache on Jennifer Lopez's face made me want to punch her fiancé in the face. It was so awkward and sincere that I felt like someone cheated on me, which was awful but in a good way.Charlie brings Kat down to earth a little more while they stay married for 6 months, which was Kay's idea, by just being himself and challenging her to do more things on her own, without a whole team helping her out in her day to day life.He's an ordinary math teacher who just wants his daughter to be happy and encourage the kids to win the mathalon. Charlie is surprised to see that Kat may be famous but she's not full of herself, and that allows them to open up to each other.They begin to really connect when Kat finally gets the nomination she's been dreaming of, which, unfortunately, brings her ex back into her life. Charlie sees how happy Kat is in her world and fears he doesn't belong by her side so he ends things after seeing a livestream of Kat's performance with her ex. He leaves before he can get his heart broken, and I find that so relatable.Charlie goes back to his old life but things just aren't the same for him or the Popstar. Kat is seen doing things on her own and writing a song that makes you yearn for love. Charlie sees Kat's face everywhere.By the end of the movie, you can tell what the ending is going to be but it still tugs at your heart. Kat runs from Jimmy Fallon's show after admitting that the love song she wrote wasn't for her famous ex at all. She tries to get a plane ticket to the mathalon on her own, but she finds that it's much more difficult than she thought. Luckily, her manager is there to help her get to where she needs to go. She misses the big moment for Charlie's daughter but speaks up and holds a sign asking him to marry her... again.The supporting actors and actresses are so talented and deserve a huge mention because they help bring the main characters more humanity and bring comedic relief to the drama when needed.I've watched it twice and I love the music. The story is easy to map out in your head from the start but it's worth watching to get that happy feeling.

As with most rom-coms, it is predictable and cheesy with some cute moments and overall charm. 'Marry Me' also had the addition of some decent songs in its mix as well as diversity that didn't feel forced for the sake of only being relevant.It kicks right into the meat of the movie right from the get-go, and that was honestly probably the roughest spot. J-Lo's character and her initial fiancé are set up to tie the knot at a concert in front of millions of fans, and when his affair breaks on the media, she demands to find out what's going on as she's going on stage, having no choice but to face the world as the news hits her. Owen Wilson is a random guy in the crowd who happens to be holding a ""Marry Me"" sign, and she decides to marry him instead. He agrees. This was shown in the trailer, so it's not really a spoiler. If anything, it was the cringiest moment, and it was the moment that felt the most forced.Moving on to the rest of the movie, it had its charming moments, and you know this couple is gonna work out and fall in love. The biggest speed bump for me is I didn't feel the chemistry between J-Lo and Owen. Maybe it's because rom-coms are her thing, and his space is in comedies. His odd, slow voice work really stilted the dialogue and the cute moments, and he felt monotone for most of the movie. I just found it hard to believe that J-Lo's character would fall for him, but it was still charming, of course, to see them end up together.On the other hand, the soundtrack is gonna be a good one. The music was easy to get into. The fashion was on point. The dialogue was dry at times, but the acting was good in all the right places.

Owen Wilson is a passable leading man when there's real comedy involved such as the Wedding Crashers, but he can NOT carry a movie that has no comedy. The kissing scenes between JLO and Wilson were lackluster and best and he honestly looked bored. Zero chemistry between these two in general. The movie feels like another attempt by JLO to suck us into yet another reality show about her life. The music was barely passable and completely forgettable. Instead of portraying an endearing character, which is what I believe JLO was going for as it was hard to tell, who struggles to find love, i found JLO's character to be cringy to say the least.

The woman who is actually a and thrice-divorced pop superstar that seems turned into more product than a person.At the first glance, Lopez is already the heart of the picture, which rests on her warmth and pureness of being a superstar. She shows how a pure woman went on a media to display her fame, because of her song.The screenplay might as well have been composed by a calculation to hit each romantic comedy beat, from the meet-charming to the enchanted association with the misfortune to the blissful completion, yet it merits extra credit for what it dodges.If I were going to ask, ""Is the film worth to watch?""

But most of the movie just felt like a big music video or promo tour for Jennifer Lopez. I get that she's a singer as well in the movie. But it focused TOO much on it, like ""hey look at me, look how great I look"". Every 5 minutes it was her singing.. and it wasn't just a snippet it was like the whole song.And the way she dressed, she has a great body don't get me wrong.. but the dress she wore to the school prom.. just didn't seem appropriate
at all!All Charlie wanted was to see the natural side to her.. without heavy makeup.. and hair extensions. But not once did we ever get to see that side. Even the day after she has so much makeup on.And when she was nominated for the award she was genuinly happy, and he was just ""meh, I want to leave that behind"". When he turns up at the after party because he's insecure he straight just dumps her when she's done nothing wrong. It felt so rushed.. and to go from this to marry eachother again, how on earth would they make it work when they are clearly so opposite from one and other. In Notting Hill, Julia makes it clear that awards and fame doesn't even mean anything.. and she takes a years break from it all to stay indefinitely with William in London.

The movie keeps the same basic premise, but otherwise is your standard rom-com: boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy decides it won't work, and boy finally comes to his senses.Also, the original character from the comic was more like a young Brittany Spears, and JLo is a bit long in the tooth for that role. Owen Wilson is also a bit past his prime to play the male lead. The only thing they kept from the comic was the boy's lesbian friend Parker.In the comic, the Owen Wilson character was named Guy, which added to the humor - in that she marries some guy who's actually named Guy. I guess the writers thought that was too cerebral, as they changed his name to Charlie.Basically, if you like rom-coms, you'll probably like this.

tt5834426,ur4248714,4,15 February 2022,"It sounds similar to the great James Bond movie, but it is actually director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow) up to his old tricks, finding some way for the world to end. Basically, in 2011, astronauts Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) and Jocinda ""Jo"" Fowler (Halle Berry) on a mission in space repairing a satellite when a mysterious black swarm spreads and attacks the orbiter. Fowler is knocked unconscious, and Harper helps her into the ship, but a crewmate is killed. Eighteen months pass since the investigation started, nobody believes Harper's explanation and Fowler has no memory of what happened; human error is blamed, and Harper is fired. Ten years later, K. C. Houseman (Game of Thrones' John Bradley) is a conspiracy theorist who believes the Moon is an artificial megastructure. He discovers that the Moon is out of orbit and is veering closer to Earth. During a visit to his mother Elaine (Kathleen Fee) in a care hone, as she is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, she convinces him he should confront someone from NASA with whatever evidence he has found. He tries to convince Harper of his findings, but he is dismissed, leading Houseman to go public on social media. NASA independently discovers the anomaly and confirms that Houseman's claims are true, so a mission is mounted to investigate the abnormality. The mission crew reach the Moon, and a probe is dropped into a large crater, but the same strange swarm that had attacked Harper's mission reappears, killing all three crew members aboard. As the Moon's orbit continues to deteriorate, it falls closer to Earth, causing cataclysmic disasters such as tsunamis, gravitational abnormalities, and atmospheric dissipation. Fowler, now the deputy director of NASA, meets with former NASA official Holdenfield (Donald Sutherland), who helped to cover up the dark side of the Moon mystery that occurred during the two-minute radio blackout on the Apollo 11 mission. A military program code-named ZX7 which would attempt to kill the swarm with a blast of EMP (electromagnetic pulse) was created but abandoned for budget reasons. Following Fowler's orders, the EMP is brought out of storage, and the retired Space Shuttle Endeavour is taken from its museum, to attempt this mission and stop whatever is causing the destruction to Earth. Having survived tidal waves spreading through the city, Harper and Houseman have teamed up to show their findings, and Fowler recruits them for the mission. The trio launch the rocket with the EMP, narrowly escaping a tsunami that destroys Vandenberg Space Force Base. They reach the Moon and enter its interior, discovering that the outer shell is housing extra-terrestrial technology. The swarm is causing sabotage to the energy generated by the technology in the core of the Moon, causing the artificial megastructure's orbit to destabilise as its power source is depleted. Harper learns that the megastructure was constructed by the ancestors of humanity, who were more technologically advanced than their present-day descendants. The Moon was constructed billions of years in the past as an ark to repopulate humanity, which was being hunted by a rogue artificial intelligence that grew too strong, the swarm in the Moon is one of those Ais. As the Moon continues to fall to Earth, the President of the United States gives General Jenkins (Frank Schorpion) orders to launch a nuclear strike towards the Moon. However, the Air Force Chief of Staff General Doug Davidson (Eme Ikwuakor), Fowler's ex-husband, refuses to carry out the nuclear strike order so he can give Fowler, Harper and Houseman time to save Earth, sacrificing his life in the process. Meanwhile, Harper's son Sonny (All the Money in the World's Charlie Plummer) escorts Fowler's son Jimmy (Zayn Maloney) and their nanny Michelle (Kelly Yu) to reach Davidson's military bunker in Colorado. They reach Aspen and reunite with Harper's ex-wife and Sonny's mother Brenda Lopez (Carolina Bartczak), her husband Tom (Michael Peña) and the stepfamily but are caught in the disasters caused by the Moon's rapid destruction. As the group makes their way towards the bunker, they fight off other survivors and increasingly deadly natural disasters before reaching a safe mountain tunnel. Tom sacrifices himself to save his youngest daughter, he suffocates when the Moon's gravitational pull causes the oxygen in the atmosphere to deplete. Harper and Fowler argue as they realise that there is no option to activate the explosive device manually and who should sacrifice themselves to do so, but Houseman takes it himself and in the lunar module lures the swarm away from the spacecraft. After allowing Harper and Fowler to escape, Houseman detonates the device, killing himself and destroying the AI. Power is restored to the core of the Moon, and it begins to return to its regular orbit, bringing an end to the destruction on Earth. The operating system of the Moon then brings Houseman's consciousness back to life, having stored a copy of it, and the AI appears to him as his mother. While Fowler and Harper return to Earth and reunite with Sonny, Jimmy, Michelle, and Brenda, the AI tells Houseman that they ""need to get to work"". Having seen the trailer, I assumed it just going to be a simple story with the Moon knocked out of orbit by an anomaly in space, I didn't realise an alien force would be responsible haha, but what does it matter? The acting talent is there, Berry and Wilson being serious, and Bradley being likeable, and the special effects are undoubtedly spectacular, with tidal waves, storms, cars flying in zero gravity and other crazy calamities across the world. In all honesty, it is ludicrous and stupid in almost every way possible, with alien gloop and the Moon made of cheese or whatever, and a silly script (in the realm of something like Sharknado), but in a way that's a good thing, a non-sensical and ridiculous but almost worthwhile science-fiction disaster.

Certain people have to try to put things right, and lots of people have crises.Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 - I think we can now spot the Emmerich formula at work. A cataclysmic crisis of some sort occurs. We meet various people involved in and/or impacted by it and, with a bit of luck, we identify and empathise with some of them. These include somebody very able but disgraced, a dysfunctional family who love each other really, a seperated couple where one is pretty good at getting to the heart of the issue while the other has the ear of someone who matters, a new husband to an ex-wife who is a bit of a dick at first but comes through in the end and then dies, and so on. And all of this takes place against a backgroud of CGI-heavy destruction porn, presented with some pseudo-scientific piffle, but otherwise outrageously impossible.Indepence Day incensed me because it assumed I was stupid. But after a succession of films which are equally nonsensical, I'm thinking maybe Emmerich doesn't assume his audience is stupid. Maybe the stupid lies elsewhere.The eye candy is fun.

The only thing I mildly enjoyed was some cool-looking scenes of destruction. Even the space stuff, which is normally an automatic plus for me, added nothing. Maybe it's missing the feel of space that good directors like Christopher Nolan are able to capture. Or maybe it's because I didn't care about the story or the characters even a tiny bit.Speaking of characters... what characters? They're all cardboard cutouts. You have zero investment in any of them. They spew lines of atrocious dialogue that sound like they were written by a computer program.While watching this, I kept noticing different things copied from various movies. This is fine if the movie is well-made, or if the copying is just for a portion of the movie. But this movie is poorly-made, and the copying seems to make up the entire thing.And while each of the movies it stole from likely delved deep into that concept, this movie just throws it in there as an afterthought. There are so many useless side plots. These are things that could have worked if they narrowed it down and focused on a couple.This movie is really dumb. I kept trying to forgive the flaws and give it a chance, but less than halfway through I started laughing at the stupidity. I had to make sure I didn't laugh too loud in case someone was enjoying it somehow.Seriously, I can't emphasize how dumb this movie is. Throughout. And I don't just mean the science and lack of believability, I can get past that. But very simple things like, for example, when a character tells another, ""You're the only one who believed me."" And I think to myself, ""Wait... WHAT??? He didn't believe you and had security escort you off the premises."" The movie is jam-packed with this type of nonsense.In the end, if you can't, at the very least, deliver entertaining mayhem, then you have failed.

Roland Emmerich film which he always does disaster films and having a story of catastrophic events and characters that are trying to survive the event. Cheesy as it is, this film is one of his best films. Sure, the script can be cheesy with John Bradley's character and his humor. The plot is great. The film does have a twist in direction right before the climax when the three characters Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley head to the moon and make a discovery that can change the course of history. Also, the film borrows similar concepts to other sci fi films like The Abyss and such.The cast did great. Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley all did great. Michael Pena playing a small role was also okay. Charlie Plummer playing Brian Harper's son with a sub plot of him being a troubled teen. And is with Halle Berry's son and her exchange student trying to survive the cataclysmic event on Earth. With the moon coming close and gravity waves causing destruction. The film is action packed.

His movies may not always make logical sense but he does know his way around a disaster movie and how to make it exciting. John plays a conspiracy theorist that discovers the Moon's orbit is deteriorating and is going to eventually hit the Earth. He tries telling NASA and other authorities but no one believes him-he is a conspiracy theorist, remember? Patrick-a former astronaut-who has had his own share of problems with NASA, reluctantly starts to believe John. Especially when the Moon starts getting bigger and the tides start rolling in. Halle plays the head of NASA and Michael plays a car salesman with connections to Patrick. What is causing the Moon to act this way, after so many years of being a perfect little Moon? Is it just tired of going around in circles or maybe it's some mysterious alien force that's responsible? If I was guessing, I'd go with the second one. There is a small cameo with Donald Sutherland-I guess he had some free time on his hands-that will make conspiracy fans salivate.It's rated PG-13 for violence, disaster action, language and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",24,67,/user/ur2929860/?ref_=tt_urv

I had caught one of the trailers - at the cinema for a different film - and didn't hold high hopes for it, especially with the 'Don't Look Up' similarity, though thought the humour/silliness might carry it over the line.Yet, the humour is poor and it's in fact the more serious elements that come to the fore. I honestly enjoyed the sci-fi bits of it and the more dramatic stuff. The comedy is very lame, I don't think I even smirked once to be honest. They should've just played it totally straight, in my opinion anyway. The special effects, meanwhile, are a positive.The cast, when not comedic, work fairly well together. Halle Berry, John Bradley - who may be at the front of the limp jokes but he as an actor is likeable enough that I didn't dislike him at all - and Patrick Wilson - who I always forget the name of, I was literally trying to recall him throughout the film and I still didn't crack it - are a solid trio when serious. The support cast, spearheaded by Michael Peña, are meh.Unfortunately it's a 6/10 rating from me.

There is no such thing in the military, and this guy was about as convincing as a general as my brother Mark is as a comic book store manager.

Parts are well placed and timed to be maximum for laughsJohn Bradley is the funniest in regards to writing, style, and delivery a real fun characterDoes not feel too overdone on most scenes and momentsThe Sound Editing
It adds to the science fiction atmosphere and elevates the scenes to really bring the disaster to lifeHelps immerse you into the movie and give you that theater rumbling goodness fans love without blowing out your ear drumsPlays nicely with the musical overtures that the movie usesThe Music
High octane symphony that really elevates the adventure and dramatic atmosphereSuper emotional moments get that goosebump inducing emotions that these movies use wellA great credit song that is out of place, but fun to listen toThe Acting:
Halle Berry does a nice job playing the central role. Blends emotional connection, strong power, and relatable in the position, though does not seem fully into it.Patrick Wilson approaches the trouble astronaut role well, and gets the layered role of father and friend marginally well, though there was more neededJohn Bradley nails the role altogether and was my favorite and strongest actor of the bunch. He's funny, he's quirky, he's the character that holds so much together, and Bradley accomplishes much of the acting to solid balance and levels.-The rest of the characters are fine and accomplish the roles to some solidarity, but there are disconnects and limited roles that need time to expand.The Physics:
Takes a more realistic approach to solving and figuring out the problem seem more realistic than the usual plotsA nice representation of aeronautics, calculations, and displaying the science behind such an event, alongside the repercussions that come about with it.The Visuals
Fantastic visuals that somehow still make these extreme events feel very realisticA majority of the fallout on the Earth is displayed beautifully, primarily anything to do with water or meteor showers that you've seen in the trailer. Once in a full scene and sequence, they really are popping.The theoretical events we can propose look pretty cool, worthy of the chaos of a ride or video game, but with much better graphics and focus.Animated the source of the destruction quite well, alongside much of the design of the science fiction elements that you may have seen in the movie.The design and imaging accomplish a lot and are really the selling factor for the movieThe Nostalgia
Easter eggs galore in this movie, a cavalcade of homages that play towards the previous library.Plenty of moments that reference Armageddon, The Abyss, Independence Day, Deep Impact, and more for you have fun picking up the inspirational momentsPart of the fun of uncovering them all and distracting you from some of the other plot elementsDISLIKES:Predictable:
You can find much of the plot into the trailer and it makes for a bit of an eye rolling momentAll the homages guide you towards where the movie will be going and how the movie is just going to endThe set up for the sequel that should not need to come is a bit groan worthy and should not be needed.The Character Development:
One character, K. C., is done well, complete and a fantastic character, but others have components not fully fleshed out or connected leading to weaker characters.Several arcs are limited and rushed too quickly due to the fast pace, leading to some haphazard moments that feel hastily patched together.Secondary characters are very forced and one dimensional, making some of the writing a bit cheesy or weaker than I think intended.Donald Sutherland's Role rather pointless
He's not in it for long and though a great performance, lacks any really meat to the inclusion they wantedThe mystery element behind what is causing the trouble is a weak link that again needs more time and development in the grand scheme.The Cohesiveness
At times, the movie is not very flowing, and has rough patches that don't quite flow like others have done.Makes the movie feel jumpy and feel a bit tattered, with many elements feeling again incomplete and rushed, not holding the same adventure others have doneThe Story:
The movie has a lot of stretches of the imagination that can be hard to stack as the movie goes on and how we would struggle to recoverThe antagonism of much of the movie feels like it is missing something and feels unnecessary and cheesy at timesThe physics and rules are changed near the end of the movie and start to play by new rules that further disrupt the cohesive and realistic tone they started setting.Dumps a few characters a little too readily, leading to again incomplete roles and stories they tried to stuff inThe nature of the story takes a ninety-degree turn that does not fit together, takes a different tone, and may be executed at the wrong timeThe new turn and back story feel very cheesy, ludicrous, and dividing that is going to turn many off after the work done in the first 75% of the movie.The VERDICT:Moonfall is a movie that was a bit cheesy to begin with, but for much of the movie felt at home in the disaster flick genre. Its highlights are again a fast pace and the popcorn munching thrills we seek in these movies; despite the lack of logic, they can hold. Like many movies, the investment into great sound, music, and visual editing creates the stuff many might ponder and brings the imagination to full life. Even the acting gets nods at times, and there are several characters enjoyable to watch in the movie. However, the movie does suffer from some cohesive issues and has weaker characters and stories that are a bit too familiar and limited. All the homages paid to the disaster movies of the best are fun, but gluing them together does not have the same spunk and flow that the predecessors had. This is especially true for the turn to the story, that resets the rules and further makes the concept ridiculous, as the already farfetched story becomes quite silly and corny to break the illusion.Overall, the scores are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.0

As always the issue is discovered by some small time American and its up to America to save the world. Sigh. In the end it honestly felt like they were trying to tell different stories.Now I actually think there could have been real potential here. It was the statement about two consciousnesses or entities battling against each other that might have had bones for a decent sci-fi film. If someone like Nolan or another capable director was at the helm perhaps the AI storyline could have been explored? The science would need to be more solid but it could be creative and work.

Here's a tip to enjoy this action movie: turn off your brain and just enjoy the ride. You're probably going to laugh at how bad the movie is, which can actually be kind of fun. Get some popcorn while you watch it on the biggest screen you can. If you get a kick out of director Roland Emmerich's epic disaster movies, here ya go. One of my favorites of his is Independence Day. This film has some elements of that movie but is nowhere near as good.THINGS I LIKED:

Unfortunately, not all of it lands.Gravity wave.

One of the characters states, ""This is a whole other level of insane."" Yeah, that's what some viewers are saying about this movie too. The plot is super silly with very little logic. There's a lot of science talk, but not much of it makes sense or really seems plausible. Characters also make illogical decisions and consequences are often muted.A lot of the dialogue is very weak, cliched, and so predictable.The characters are super cliched and shallow. There is a laughable amount of overacting and a surprising amount of really bad acting moments. Ultimately, we just don't really care that much about most of the characters and whether they live or die.Some of the CGI looks really cool, but at other times, i's disappointingly not.The trailer gives away a lot of the story.There's a ridiculous side story about some rednecks that chase after some of the kids of the astronauts.There is a TON of exposition in Act 3.Michael Pena is always such a great highlight in action movies like this. Sadly, he was terribly underutilized and we didn't get to see him truly shine.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

But Brian who was also in that mission said, ''It was swamp which attack them''. But, no one believes him and he is fired..
Several years have passed. Brian is leading a normal life. One day, a conspiracy theorist K. C Houseman discovered that the moon is getting closer to earth.

tt5834426,ur109135693,5,8 February 2022,"After having some success in the past with Stargate (1994), Independence Day (1996) and The Patriot (2000), director Roland Emmerich also became known as the science fiction, disaster-film guy, because of his quick run, in just a five year span, between The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and 2012 (2009). Both were very popular movies. Throw in White House Down (2013) and the remake of Midway (2019), and any other high-powered, action-packed, directorial effort, that Emmerich has done and that is what you get in Moonfall (2022).Moonfall (2022), takes the conspiracy theory idea, that our Moon is hollow, was built by space aliens and creates a disaster film of orbital proportions. That's right! The Moon is crashing into the Earth and it takes our gathered heroes, for this time around, to save the world. As usual, Emmerich gathers an all-star cast (a staple in disaster movies, as far back as the 1970s), lead by Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson and Game of Thrones alum, John Bradley. There's even a gratuitous two minute cameo by Donald Sutherland.Everything that happens in this movie happened already in another Roland Emmerich film. With each scene, I saw something that came from one of his other films. It was a carbon copy of everything that came before it. Let's call it a highlight film of his previous work. The cast makes the film work. Bradley is set up as the comedy relief, just like he was in Game of Thrones (2011-2019). Some of the dialogue is cheap and silly. The build up for the film is slow and it's a little too long too. It's not a terrible film, nor is it good either. I think I'll give it an ""E"" for effort. I would still go see it in theaters for the special effects spectacle on the big screen. There are however, much better Roland Emmerich choices out there. Independence Day (1996), just happens to be a favorite of mine.4.9 (E+ MyGrade) = 5 IMDB.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur109135693/?ref_=tt_urv

Director: Roland Emmerich.Starring: Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, John Bradley, Charlie Plummer, Michael Pena, Carolina Bartczak, Donald Sutherland, etc.A mysterious force knocks the moon from its orbit around Earth and sends it hurtling on a collision course with life as we know it. With mere weeks before impact and the world on the brink of annihilation, a NASA executive and former astronaut Jo Fowler is convinced she has the key to saving everyone. But only one astronaut from her past, Brian Harper and a conspiracy theorist KC Houseman believer her. This movie was just a complete mess.The film did have strong cinematography. The set up was good and the characters were likeable. With some interesting elements and ideas that were introduced and explored. Some of the action was entertaining and the score was solid.However, the pacing was extremely rushed and terrible, never allowing anything to fully process or develop properly. The structure of the movie was a complete mess and all over the place. There was countless inconsistencies with the logic that were just too ridiculous. The characters and the plot itself were very generic. I didn't connect with any of the characters. The script was very bad and the dialogue felt very recycled and corny, like it was supposed to be released 20 years ago. The characters lacked chemistry with each other, perhaps due to the poor writing. The CGI in parts was surprisingly bad considering the high budget, the obvious green screen was often very distracting. There was either inconsistent or underwhelming action. It was tonally inconsistent and felt like 3 different movies, and the final act, despite introducing some interesting ideas was a mess and it failed with its execution.Overall, Moonfall has brief moments of entertainment, great visuals and Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry try their best. But this movie was poorly written, inconsistent and messy. This film didn't have a clue what it wanted to be and it just turned into a poorly executed disaster movie that failed on all levels.Overall Score 32/100.",0,0,/user/ur101128147/?ref_=tt_urv

tt5834426,ur16320420,7,9 February 2022,"Roland Emmerich loves disaster movies, if he can tinge it with some sci-fi elements, all the better, but there must be an epic disaster inside otherwise it's not exciting enough for him. That's the way it seems to me at least. I haven't seen all his movies, and it seems to me that his lust for disaster is growing with time. In this one it has grown so much he decided not only to drop all attempt to suspend our disbelief but simply to fight any chance we could suspend it. In fact it's as if he's making an effort we never forget we're seeing something impossible that was made possible only through his vision. Hence my title - It took me two days to think this one out - and not in a good way. It's not like I kept on thinking about the deep impact the movie has left on me. I was simply annoyed and couldn't put my finger on the precise reason. I mean every time I got absorbed in the narrative another impossible thing would happen, often not even driven by the plot itself, sometimes even against the logic of the plot. I personally can't see a sci-fi that tries so hard to make sure I stay uninvolved with its story.It's plain shame as the three leads gave very good performances. I've never seen Patrick Wilson doing better. Halle Berry is always professional and she doesn't disappoint this time too and John Bradley is simply wonderful. Donald Sutherland gets a tiny role and still manages to deliver and so does Stephen Bogaert as the ultimate bureaucrat who flickers on the screen for a few seconds only to leave it all for Halle Berry. So all the important roles were well written and I did care - I believe we all did , but if all they do is repeatedly either impossible or senseless - what's the point.

It's not so bad it's good, it's so bad it's interesting, you want to see how all this nonsense plays out.Mind you, Halle Berry acts bad, too, just like everybody else, but, she's so hot that it also doesn't make any sense, really. It's kind of interesting that her acting reminds one of Bruce Willis' acting in the last several years.So, if you don't have anything better to do, you can watch the first 20 minutes to see Halle Berry in regular clothes and be amazed.

tt5834426,ur44376731,3,28 February 2022,"'Moonfall' is a 2022 action disaster film from director Roland Emmerich who, ever since 'Independence Day', has made a career out of directing these types of large, end-of-the-world, effects driven films. 'Independence Day' really marked the high point and ever since then most of his large clunky films have been varying degrees of trash, and if the February release date didn't tip you off 'Moonfall' is just more of the same. The film stars Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry as astronauts trying to stave off, you guessed it, the end of the world. John Bradley and Charlie Plummer costar. It is always nice to see 'Game of Thrones' alumni get work. The film cost a hefty $140 to produce and has woefully underperformed at the box office.In 2011 three astronauts are on a routine mission when something occurs and one astronaut is killed and Patrick Wilson's Brian Harper is forced to make an emergency return to Earth with an unconscious Jocinda Fowler, played by Halle Berry. Harper says they were attacked. Everyone labels him crazy and he leaves NASA in disgrace blamed for the incident. Ten years later Fowler is one of the head's of NASA and Wilson has fallen on hard times and is divorced with a kid he doesn't see who has become somewhat of a problem teen. John Bradley plays Houseman who is a conspiracy theorist and believes the moon is a megastructure which is basically a huge mechanical apparatus constructed by aliens. One day he discovers that the moon is essentially getting closer to Earth and very soon will fall into our atmosphere. From there the tale spins out into a disaster epic as moon pieces fall to Earth and gravity runs amok as a small group of folks including the three mentioned protagonists try to get together a plan to save the Earth from the moon crashing into it. There is a side plot as Charlie Plummer plays Harper's kid and is trying to get himself and a couple other people to safety including Fowler's young son.This is bright and shiny trash. It is not without that bright and shiny entertainment value, but it is trash nonetheless. It is a long time removed since Emmerich could make a film at the level of 'Independence Day'. This film doesn't have much original going for it. Pick your disaster science fiction movie and this film probably cobbles together elements from it. Take some 'Armageddon' and mix it with '2012' and sprinkle in some 'San Andreas' and top it off with some 'Independence Day'. It is that type of film utilizing many basic tropes some of which Emmerich himself popularized. Even with suspension of disbelief the plot is incredibly outlandish not only in overall scope, but from a world disaster management point of view. It is hilarious as NASA and the government are pretty much like forget this and are going to go hunker down to attempt to ride this out, and therefore it is left to literally a handful of people to develop and execute a highly improbable space mission to save everyone. Ridiculous is quite the understatement. The entire side plot with the kids was boring and uninspired and amounts to nothing but filler. I will say when the space mission finally gets off the ground the movie enters some more interesting and less cliché territory, however, the overall product is already so far off the rails that it really is unable to rally into anything resembling a ""good"" movie. While the film contains some interesting elements it just feels like a disaster, and not the disaster the movie was intending.Eric's Grade: D.",0,0,/user/ur44376731/?ref_=tt_urv

The dialogue is blunt and without nuance and lacks the charm of Jeff Goldblum ad-libbing in Independence Day. The pace of action is phenomenal with constant cutting between the loosely connected stories. I would say the film spreads itself too thin across the characters but at the same time I'm not sure there was much room to go any deeper with any of the story threads. The main cast do fine and are a reassuring presence amongst the chaos. I did like that this film really pushed the boundaries of the traditionally straight-forward disaster film story and some of the action in the second half is good but overall I would only recommend to someone looking for a big, brash, switch-off-you-brain type disaster film.",1,2,/user/ur37143810/?ref_=tt_urv
tt5834426,ur88854575,5,5 February 2022,"Moonfall is passable by Roland Emmerich's standards. It's undoubtedly silly, but Moonfall fixes some Emmerich problems. The story is ridiculous, the action is outrageous, and the science is nonsense, but the script is more focused than 2012 or Resurgence. The weak B-stories are minimal and serve more purpose. Supporting characters could've been condensed and their plotlines could've been enhanced, but at least there was only one side-group. Meanwhile, Berry, Wilson, and especially Bradley are engaged. Their roles lack layers or range, but they have fun. Together, these elements provide just enough relatability to keep Moonfall from being actively painful.Plus, the filmmaking behind Moonfall has some strengths. The CGI is expectedly excessive and the product placements are blatant, but those are the only glaring negatives. The visuals are occasionally pretty due to intentional lighting. The soundtrack has a consistent mood that heightens the film's mystery. The sound is symbolic during crisis and daunting when showcasing the monster. Lastly, the tone is more contained. There isn't cringey humor (though Bradley is naturally funny) and there's less melodrama, helping the film maintain a steady feel throughout. Overall, it isn't good, but there isn't as much about Moonfall to be mad at either.Writing: 3/10

tt5834426,ur3890446,7,6 February 2022,"Roland Emmerich does like to put on a show with big budget disaster movies of biblical proportions as witnessed in past movies Independence Day (1996), The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and 2012 (2009). They usually combine the threat of apocalyptic disaster with science fiction and Moonfall is no exception, in fact Emmerich goes bigger in scale and ambition than ever before but as a consequence this one is a lot harder to swallow.The German filmmaker knows how to make crowd pleasing commercial popcorn entertainment with mega budgets painting on a huge canvas with teams of special effect artists and while his films are usually littered with cliches, plot holes, corny dialogue and poor characterisation one thing is for sure, you'll be in for one hell of a ride.Here Emmerich is trusting the audience to make several leaps of implausibility to come on board with his silly yet intriguing concept as to why the Moon has drifted out of orbit and is hurtling towards Earth. This in turn causes huge tidal waves, mass flooding and bits of meteorite to come crashing down into towns and cities all over the world ending civilisation as we know it.It's left to two astronauts and a geeky conspiracy theorist to save the Earth from impending destruction. Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry do a reasonable job in making you believe in all the shenanigans, even managing to steal an old space shuttle from a museum to make it launch ready in the blink of an eye. John Bradley steals the show at times with his hokey scientific theories providing some much needed comic relief while Donald Sutherland has a brief cameo as a retired Apollo 11 astronaut who harbours a secret about the dark side of the moon.The usual sub-plots of broken relationships and personal angst are present to provide prerequisite vignettes of humanity that help break up all the mayhem in an attempt to hang the story on an emotional thread. Emmerich wants you to suspend your disbelief, enjoy the visuals and go along for the ride as you witness the cataclysmic end of the world done on an epic scale.I saw this in a 4DX cinema where you can feel every bump, jolt and rumble to make you feel like you're hurtling around in space or being chased at high speed over rough terrain and although gimmicky with wind and rain blowing in your face the jolting effects were quite violent to sit through. The audience were really getting thrown around in their seats at times and even caused motion sickness unlike other 4DX presentations I have experienced.Moonfall is a welcome return to the disaster genre for a director who excels at ending the world in inventive ways. Critics and science fiction purists probably won't like it but I really enjoyed the ride and have rated this 7 out of 10 for sheer broad stroke entertainment that is thrilling, fast paced and visually impressive.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur3890446/?ref_=tt_urv

Halley Berry, Patrick Wilson and John have amazing chemistry together on screen, which is what makes this film a joy to watch. So Let's talk about the different characters let's start off with the one that people think is nuts, you guessed it JohnJohn,He does so well in his respected role. He has a theory that the moon is coming down to earth, so he tries to tell people about this and everyone thinks he's crazy, I mean why wouldn't they, am I right?. And when he meets the astronaut played buy ( Patrick wilson ) he tells him that everyone is in danger because the moon is crashing down so Patrick wilson throws him out as he thinks he's crazy. But John doesn't stop there and gathers up some more people with the promise of free bagels, and tells them about the whole moon situation. So when he is in fact right they start believing in him. And I like the little moments with his mum it's short but it's sweet. And In the end they join forces to try and save the people of earth, John, Halley and Patrick.Halley Berry,She's an ex wife of two children. And as to be expected she does worry too much, being that over protecting parent that we ( may or may not of had ). So I like how she is relatable and tries to do what's best for her son. And she works for ( NASA ) so she is also an astronaut as well. And is one of the ones who finds an entity living inside the moon forcing it to crash down ( I won't say what ).Patrick,Patrick instead of him being an Ex wife he's an ex husband with a son and hes also broke. With his son also hating him. His son was sent to prison so Patrick did try everything in his power to not let them take him into jail ' hes a good kid, just made a mistake ' he says not whilst in court but later on in the film, that depicts him as a farther who loves his son very much.So I just love the arc, the journey we go on with these main protagonists are just really interesting. So is the action and cinematography with nice neat direction. And stunning visual effects. And side characters who aren't actually all that bad either. With some funny Witty lines of dialogue. And a good score to boot.Bad bits,
Some of the jokes do fall flat for me, and I didn't think the third act was anywhere near as good as it could of been. And unfortunately for this film it has been done to dust so that also does drag the movie down. But if you don't take it too seriously you will have a blast I promise you that much.

It made sense, it is obviously far fetched but movies are escapism so I don't mind that.Start with the positives, the effects were really good, the story was pretty fresh and different and there were good twists and turns throughout, it didn't drag and for me was just a really good mindless film that I thoroughly enjoyed.There are negatives, the dialogue is pretty weak, the acting isn't at a phenomenal level but you still care and like them enough that it works. There were moments of things that would be classed as ridiculous decision making but also I guess we don't know for sure what we'd do in those circumstances. But stopping the car to get out and watch whilst a huge wave comes is probably not something I'd do.It's mindless fun, I think if you're taking it seriously or are a sci fi fan that has to dissect everything that you probably won't enjoy it.

Remember The Giant Behemoth? It Came from Beneath the Sea? Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers? The Monster That Challenged the World? The Blob? 20 Million Miles to Earth? Tarantula? You might have seen one or two on Turner Classic Movies, but most likely have seen all of them on Svengoolie on MeTV. Like them all, Moonfall has a preposterous concept that has hard science fiction concepts, but its storytelling qualifies it as fairly light science fiction and like them also Moonfall presents its story with verisimilitude rather than making the occasional wink at the audiences that the filmmakers are well aware of how ridiculous the concept they're working from.Like the movies I mentioned though, Moonfall is far from great. It is, at best, a 6 out of 10 on the rating scale, you probably could do worse with such an idea and to be honest I am not so sure if you could even do it better than it is (I think even a Christopher Nolan would take a look at it and only muster in a low 7 out of 10 probably).The cast all do fine, at this point I am convinced that Patrick Wilson will do well with any role in any film, John Bradley is pretty enjoyable, and Donald Sutherland does pretty good in a bit part.

This film is no different on many aspects, but does seem to flow better in spots with a solid plot and solid cast. The story isn't groundbreaking but holds a decent enough level of intrigue and suspense throughout. The pure spectacle is gargantuan and a feast for the eyes and just what you'd want for a film focused around the Moon. I'll mention that the cast is very welcome and Patrick Wilson is once again an underrated driving force. There's a certain bit of comedy that actually works well for this type of film.

tt5834426,ur65497206,5,7 February 2022,"""Moonfall"" sounds like a new James Bond film, but it's not.The gorgeous Halle Berry climbs on board a graffiti encrusted retired Space Shuttle one more time with her buff co-pilot Patrick Wilson for one more trip around the moon to save planet earth from certain annihilation.Thank goodness for a fake Doctor (John Bradley) ,discovering before NASA, that a mysterious force has knocked the moon off its orbit around Earth.In effect our Moon is like a huge Pinball machine screaming out ""TILT""!This alien force on the moon is life, but not as we know it Jim.The main cast is supported by a string actors in a counter productive sub plot trying to get to higher, safer ground including: Michael Pena, Charlie Plummer (the late Christoper Plummers' relation) and others.The 2 hour 10 min runtime could have been sliced significantly without this other story.It's like when you order a great steak and the restaurant gives you a side dish you will only play with your fork, but never actually eat.At first the math in this movie added up, then it went south quicker than a downhill skier in the Winter Beijing Olympics.The majority of the special effect (CGI) was spectacular and you could see where the $150 million budget went, however the tidal scenes were like watching a model train set derail.Meanwhile the interior moon shots are worthy of ""Alien"" or even dare I say it ""Star Wars"".Watch out for: the iconic Donald Sutherland who only gets one lousy scene and then blows his brains out. Maybe because he finally read the script which director Roland Emmerich had a hand in.Emmerich loves a good disaster movie, he's been in charge of a few. (20212, The Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla)

tt5834426,ur0127599,5,4 February 2022,"Being a Millennial, I can attest to our generation that it was a great time to be alive with ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"" being some of our favorite tween-age blow-up-knock-down action movies to go see with our friends in the theater 3 times in the same day, with campy yet lovable characters like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Those were the days. I still enjoy watching those flicks from time to time - not just for the nostalgia. They are still quite entertaining in their own right.Now we have ""Moonfall"" some 25 years later. Cut from the same construction paper, but more like pieces of old scripts from Roland Emmerich's late '90s writing room shredder taped together in hopes the characters and dialog would be usable in telling the grandiose destructo-type story instead of just talking props. Speaking of which, I give props to Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley (who actually had a solid character to go with his style) for trying, but it simply wasn't enough.I've listened to commentaries and interviews with Emmerich and I personally think he doesn't have good instincts on how to put a balanced action film together since the mid 2000s (with the ID4 sequel, if you watch the deleted scenes cut what would've been the best and most meaningful scenes of the entire movie) with the aim of just going big and loud, using any means whatsoever. It works...until it doesn't. Action fatigue sets in frequently in this and many of his recent past movies. It's alarming when I am physically incapable of caring less about the world ending than watching these characters attempt to get from beginning to end - in fact, there was no palpable peril despite the entire earth getting properly f'ed up, we only see it in overhead shots of floods and earthquakes and meteorites (I think COVID may have had something to do with not being able to have scenes with dozens of extras on the ground clamoring over each other like in all other action flicks from the days of yore).However, the concept was intriguing and in my opinion, pretty great. It reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's ""Rendezvous with Rama"" but with the Moon instead of a floating cylinder in space. I really did enjoy watching the last 20-30 mins or so play out after an hour and a half of random skipping around characters trying to hatch the plan to get us to that point while trying to make the audience like and/or care.

tt5834426,ur117768316,3,4 February 2022,"It's been quite some time since I've seen a cast full of talented, well-regarded actors all give performances that are this terrible. To be fair, given this dialogue, I don't think any actor could have pulled off a good performance.This screenplay was written by guys who have never talked to another human being before. Every line of dialogue is contrived and laughably on the nose, with exposition delivered in a way that sometimes makes Marvel's Eternals feel like a masterclass of writing.The story has enough logical holes to fit the moon through. Convenience piles on top of convenience to make catastrophe possible, and then to help the characters survive the catastrophe. It's a script that can't withstand even the slightest amount of logical thought.Moonfall makes just as little sense as 2012, and the characters are just as dull. But, in a way, this film is the more disappointing one because of how much better it could have been.The character introductions and the setup for the emotional conflicts that these characters are experiencing with each other are actually compelling and somewhat competent. But the writers do NOTHING with these conflicts once they're established. Nobody learns anything; nobody actually overcomes anything or changes at all.Not that a movie like this really needs masterful character development, but it at least needs something, ANYTHING to make us care and want these characters to succeed. But there's nothing.Not even the visual effects are particularly good; they're certainly not bad, but no improvements have been made since the 2009 release of 2012, which looked groundbreaking at the time.Still, I didn't hate watching this.

It's not a ""classic"", but it IS a fun movie to see on the big screen. It's actually a fairly unique plot and has some interesting ""turns"" in it. It has the vibes of ""Independence Day"", but a bit shy of that quality. I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did, but most effects and primary acting was good. And the character of ""Dr. KC Houseman"" was played well. From the Reel Tunez review:Moonfall has some familiar faces like Halle Berry, Patrick WIlson, and Michael Pena. The leading character for me was the memorable John Bradley as ""Dr. KC Houseman"". The movie is a sci-fi, disaster, thriller movie and for the most part looked great (one or two shots looked low budget, but it was with ""red shirt characters.. Star Trek reference to extras who'd be killed off quickly).So here's the skinny: The moon's orbit is screwed up due to ""alien thing"" (I'll only say that to not spoilt the plot). As we know, the moon impacts everything a lot of what happens on Earth (including tides), so this get rocky.It's a long movie at just over two hours, but it's a fun movie and the pace is good. This movie (thanks to the subject and visuals) IS a movie theater movie best seen on the BIG screen with great sound.I'd give Moonfall about a 6.6 out of 10.

And it's a shame, because they are great plots, but they lack talent and brains in charge. And while the catastrophe genre is appealing and Emmerich likes to involve in it , he's like the party entertainer with jokes that only he laughs at.Looking at his resume, you can see that he has great intentions that he doesn't know how to develop. For those who remember, 2012 (Geez!), The Day After Tomorrow, 1998's Godzilla, Independence Day and even The Patriot are good examples of this. You watch it, enjoy it, but when it ends, you get that impression of ""it could have been better"" or ""this premise promised much more"".

Except that this was beyond worse than what we had imagined.I like the idea of the film, that the moon is a threat to humanity. It's different but that's the only excellent thing to say about it. Other than that, it's a threat to our IQ.The biggest fault with Moonfall is that it fails to project the most basic principle to making a good disaster film which is creating a sense of fear for the audience. It almost doesn't have any, resulting in a boring entry. I did not get scared or restless, it didn't connect with me on a deeper level and it certainly doesn't have a good story to keep us at the edge of our seat hence, I couldn't care less if anyone dies. I didn't have the urgency to follow all the important people trying to put a stop from the catastrophic event because they throw all stakes out the window just like the Fast & Furious franchise. The main characters are ordinary people built extraordinarily strong.Adding the grim fact that Moonfall includes aliens composed of A. I and technology while also trying to relate to the audience by making it realistic, it falls down to the bottom of the abyss quickly. It doesn't work like other alien-based films like Prometheus or War of the Worlds did where they succeed in creating fear, showing people panicking while sucking us inside the experience.Yes, we are supposed to surrender from the sheer silliness of it but how can we when we are made to believe that its law of physics and world principles should follow ours and they broke every threshold to the point that we feel like this is a spin-off of the Transformers franchise.This marketed end-of-the-world disaster flick film is extremely ridiculous, even if you suspend your disbelief, you would never get your head around the plot. Not because you're dumb, but because the movie is, and I mean REALLY, REALLY dumb. It's like it's been written by Roland Emmerich's son and his dad helped him by putting scientific jargons to make it believable. Only if it did. 😩 And here I thought Independence Day 2: Resurgence was a trash, Moonfall is a shame to humanity's existence.Usually the end of the world presents seas of people running away, but Moonfall doesn't. It's a blockbuster movie about apocalypse and yet, it feels small at times. There even isn't that many shots that 'wow' us with horrific sceneries or powerful images like 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow. Even the CGI isn't all that good especially when a person is talking mid-shot and the CGI looks awful in the background.Now don't get me started with the cheap comedy. I'm confused whether it's intended to make us annoyed or laugh cause I didn't laugh one bit and neither did the audience I was with.I know loving or hating a film is fully entitled to a person's taste and opinion but this movie is so bad, I dare to say this; if you like the film, you are an immature person and you have a bad taste.Okay, maybe some of you are asking me to calm down as you're reading this but imagine the hundreds or thousands of scripts just stacking there in the room, unread because it's written by a nobody or it's got some minor English errors. And they chose this to be greenlit amongst those??? It saddens me that the political game of the Hollywood industry has come to this. Emmerich was a great director but his ideas have now diluted less and less.Verdict: Just when you thought Fast 9 is the most ridiculous film ever made, Moonfall steals the baton happily from its opponent.

This wasnt that flick.At this point, with the prolification of CGI, these disaster movies dont have the same feel to them. Special effects used to be fun, these are sterile and to be honest, boring. They can create pretty much anything they want on screen, and they choose a rather dull ""lots of little things is the monster+aliens"". The visuals arent fun or exciting.The script and lines are just awful. I dont know if this movie once had a soul, but all of the lines have been torn down to very basic English (read: easy to translate for Chinese audiences).

tt5834426,ur19357237,5,11 February 2022,"I believe that there are at least three levels of movies that we could consider ""fictional plots.""
1. Fantasy movies, you don't take them very seriously because you already know in advance that what you are seeing is not even remotely based on reality, and yet you enjoy watching it, for example superhero movies, Star Trek and Star Wars also fall into this category.2. True science fiction movies are based on proven scientific fact, or projected on a reasonably speculative basis. They are rare in themselves and highly appreciated, examples: Interstellar (2014), Planet of the Apes (1968), Contact (1997)
3. Frankly anti-scientific movies: not only are they not based on real or verifiable facts but they openly challenge our concepts, scientific ideas to the point of being in direct opposition to rationalism, examples, 1,000,000 BC (1966), dinosaurs and humans coexisting 10,000 BC (2008, giant carnivorous birds and humans coexisting and the undisputed queen of anti-scientific movies, ""Moonfall"" from 2022.",0,0,/user/ur19357237/?ref_=tt_urv

If I was to sum up Moonfall, it would be: Take all of Roland's past/recent disaster films, take their uninspired characters and shove them into a movie with a new disaster of the year plot. That's what this is. Uninspired tripe.Roland recently went on about the lack of originality that franchises like star trek and star wars have, that are sucking the market dry and preventing people like him getting a 'fair shot'. Well; he's not wrong about the franchise, but nor is he rolling around in creative originality either since this film is clearly a re-hash of what has been done before with similar cliché characters once again put in peril.This is the best worst film of the year.

At one stage New York is shown being destroyed and there is absolutely no lead up to it or any explanation given as to what's happening.Compare this to Independence Day where there was a huge build up and you knew people were trying to escape.

I didn't expect this to be a good film, and it definitely wasn't in the slightest. BUT, I did have a really good time watching it, hence my rating.Firstly, the characters were mainly average and I didn't mind them apart from one. Charlie Plummer as Sonny was likeable, and probably my favourite character in the cast. However, the rest of the characters were very bland with almost no personality and I found it hard to care about any of them. I particularly disliked KC and found him to be incredibly annoying and just plain bad.This leads me on to the humour which was very poor. I don't think there was a single joke I laughed at. The comedic relief character just so happened to be KC which was disappointing because he was super cringeworthy and the line delivery just fell flat alongside everything else.The pacing and narrative were both just very messy and inconsistent. I didn't mind the fast paced, action packed moments, but the attempt at introducing characters and developing the plot were unsuccessful in my opinion. I also disliked how the film ended and for the last half an hour I wasn't interested.The visual effects and cinematography in this film were okay, there were some good moments and some terrible moments. The CG was fairly poor but nothing super obvious. There were a few cool looking shots but other than this, you can tell the filmmakers didn't think much about cinematography.Lastly, as I said at the beginning of this review, I did find this film very fun! I went into it expecting a cheesy disaster movie, and that's exactly what I got out of it. It was fun to see the world resort to chaos and I especially liked the scene with the tidal wave.

Some scenes are literally 20 seconds long, and don't get enough screen and story telling time, to digest what is going on. Everything feels more and more rushed, during the entire 2h10 running time.

The visuals in Acts Two and Three of the disaster and moon are absolutely engaging and stunning. Something in my spirit says due to the runtime and casting, this film wants to be considered for the 2023 award seasons for that alone. I mean, the scene with the waves and takeoff! Like O. M. G!Could've Been Better:
The character arcs and development sucked. Everyone and everything with everyone outside of, yet somehow additionally impacted by, the moon situation felt forced and inauthentic.First: KC had promise, but the story was a disservice to him, and for the first half of the film he felt like a last minute levity call.Second: I'm not a fan of child actors as props in serious &/or sentimental story situations, and Jimmy's calm flatness is one example of why.Third: That quick ass life turn and relationship with the Harpers, and between astronaut Harper and his son, lacked chemistry and believability.Fourth: And THEN the moment between Sonny and Tom!? What!? Where the hell did that stem from? It was obviously a call to add tension.If the relationships were important, then give dedicated film time to cultivate those character dynamics.* * *
Additionally, the story was too ambitious. There seemed to be so many ideas that needed space to be executed better-especially regarding the ""ancestor origin.""OTHER THOUGHTS:1. When a denounced and made-insane astronaut crosses paths with a moon and outer-space geek regarding an aggressive and unusual entity in space impacting the moon's stability, they are called to go on a mission with an astronaut from the denounced's past to try and save the world. This is Moonfall.Act Three is the part of the film where I sat back and saw the potential that could've been with its 2 hour runtime. Unfortunately, it felt like 3 isolated story mash-ups which got in the way of Moonfall really being ""out of this world.""Act One felt extremely choppy in its attempt to set the premise for the story, give meaning and purpose to the characters, and establish the tone for the film (was it a drama, comedy, satire...).Act Two was pretty safe. By the time I got through Act One, I just saw Act Two as a simple movement of the plot with focus on the visuals.But it was Act Three where I appreciated the creative risk in regards to the moon, but it just seemed like there was a little writing greed to try and include every interesting sci-fi twist and theory possible.2. I really couldn't take Doug's face. The squinting just made it look like he was always trying not to laugh and break character.3. OMG the disaster and space/moon visuals were really amazing!4. With a runtime of 2hrs, the pro is that the film moves well to get to the action and disaster visuals. Where it lacked in story, it at least tried to make up with engagement. I also found the pacing to do a good job with attempting to mimic the feeling of alarm and disbelief of everyone in the situation.BUT...that's the con of the pacing-it moved too fast for story and character development, for me.5. The messaging direction seemed to be simple, thematic starters like ""heroism,"" ""sacrifice,"" and ""purpose"" that we were able to recognize via key characters like Fowler, Harper, Sonny, a little bit with Tom, and I think more intentionally with KC (although the film would like one to believe it was Harper).The problem for me is that due to the pacing, there was a lack of character development which didn't allow these themes to have any real depth to them. It felt a little elementary.6. I liked KC's character, as I think was the point, but I think the storyline really did him a disservice.7. Y'all know I feel about child actors... Jimmy seemed so calmly flat in a story situation that should've had him in such a mess. It was a no for me no matter how adorable he was.8. Chile, not BANDITS! What in the Last of Us...9. They really wanted that origin story in that SO bad...as much as Act Three was interesting, it was also so damn forced and stupid too.10. The biggest disappointment to me was the character development and arc. Everything felt forced for the sake of moving the plot and adding some extra tension as if seeing the disaster of the world wasn't enough. I would cringe just a little every time a character would have a sentimental moment with another because it felt so random and disingenuous. One that stands out the most is the scene between Tom and Sonny in Aspen-I never knew there was any tension between them, so where did that conversation come from?And don't even get me on the relationship and teen trajectory of Sonny and Harper...Chile, WHAT!?* * *
Overall #Moonfall gives 2012 meets - Don't Look Up meets - The Day After Tomorrow meets - iRobot - meets Arrival - meets A Wrinkle In Time - meets Eternals - meets the Druun from Raya and the Last Dragon.Honestly, it was a pretty sloppily written story with its saving grace being the disaster and space visuals. There just seemed to be a lot creative greed with this story vs picking 2 solid foundations to ride with.Additionally, I think this would've been a really nice paced out trilogy with this first film being solely on character investment with hints of this future disaster throughout because it was a really rough attempt at trying to give story and meaning to characters while also giving this stunning and engaging visual of humanity and space colliding. I could've seen this as a one year trilogy where all three parts are released before December to maintain audience engagement an interest in how everything wraps up (especially if the first film is focused primarily on foreshadowing and characters).",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur141983543/?ref_=tt_urv

I was analyse everything and telling me ( how they do that, this is madness ) i was like, am i watching a disatrous movie, is so bad it's good ?I came here with no expectations and free from any trailer or review whatsoever, but when i see the movie wasn't even shown on the main Imax theater for the first week of release. Already relegated to the n4, i had a clue that the general opinion was not good !They managed to go through and this is definitely better than the second independence day movie. It could be.Layer after layer i let myself from skeptical to euphoric.The actors were totally in phase not off putting.It awake the nerd inside me.And holly cow. It was just for me a 2022 ID4 revisited with another Video game franchise calls also.Even some shots are so close to ID4.Also a feel of 2012 and the day after tomorrow...Less long that the two movie mentionned, the video editing was fast paced and better executed.It goes straight to the point and all the very boring stuff i found like 2012 wasn't there.The editor did a brillant job.I loved the feeling of low budget, when everything is suggested. It's kinda a B movie with amazing special effect and an atmosphere that arrive a the second half but mainly it's like there was a reduced crew and this go well with the script.The visual effect were very neat despite being more rare than usual RE movie, it makes the imagination working a lot.The music was really good at some point but not as legendary as ID4 still.In a frontier of so bad is good, goofy and cringe but also a nerdy gem, polished and crazy. It's a love letter for ID4 fans and think this is the ID4-2 we should have and it could be ID4-3 spiritual movie with a beyond the catastrophy lore that going deeper since every ID4 movies.The 90's vibe is strong and this is the only movie i think ( i hope not ) that will have that good yet fragile balance between a Iron sky for exemple or a gravity.I think if you're not a ID4 fan or Rolland Emmerich amateur as well.It could be your 2022 so bad so good or a terrible experience for you.Let your inner nerd live for just two hours !",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur74260771/?ref_=tt_urv

tt5834426,ur71938322,4,3 February 2022,"Director, Roland Emmerich (The Patriot, Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow) is no stranger to developing stories regarding earth shattering events, and this is another piece to add to the puzzle. With a ""non-Conjuring"" on screen performance from Patrick Wilson (The Phantom of the Opera, The Conjuring, Insidious) alongside co-star Halle Berry (Catwoman, Gothika, Die Another Day) you're immersed into a fast-paced, out-of-world experience with Moonfall.Synopsis:""The world stands on the brink of annihilation when a mysterious force knocks the moon from its orbit and sends it hurtling toward a collision course with Earth. With only weeks before impact, NASA executive Jocinda ""Jo"" Fowler teams up with a man from her past and a conspiracy theorist for an impossible mission into space to save humanity.""What You See, Feel, and HearThis is an exceptionally fast-paced story. From start to finish you feel like you're running through the script and you can't stop. With a very complex and peculiar storyline you typically expect a buildup of detail along the way to fully comprehend what's happening. However, this film does the opposite. Without a story that allows your emotions to develop with characters, or with the relationships between the characters themselves, you're left trying to attach yourself to some piece of the story in order to feel invested with what was going on. Unfortunately, it's easy to turn to flaws with the special effects. From clear green screen distinction and video game graphics you reflect on the film and start to understand the difficulty of expressing authentic fear, sadness, or compassion with the acting performances.There were quite a few familiar names from this film with Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson sitting at the top of that list. Halle Berry gives a ""confusing"" performance as her emotions seem out of place, unauthentic, and unconvincing. Alongside the rest of the story, Wilson's performance feels rushed and unlike his previous performances, he doesn't share or express deep emotion even though the stakes have never been higher. One bright spot of acting was John Bradley (Game of Thrones, American Satan, The Brothers Grimsby) who provided a comedic performance with a backstory that you hang onto more than the main story itself.This is a digitally dominant film. While most stories focus on relationship building, character development, and plot diversity, Moonfall showcases CGI over every other aspect.My TakeI didn't enjoy this film. I believe it was poorly made in every aspect that you think of film; Acting was far off the mark, the visuals were expensive yet easy to separate, the score was unnoticeable, and the story was all over the place.

Moonfall is basically a rehash of all the big sic-fi disaster movies made over the last 20 years - Independence Day, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow etc. But inventively, they seem to have taken the worst bits of all these movies and blended them into Moonfall. It's like a ""lowbrid"". All the clichées of divorced couples with missing kids providing useless subplots during the story. The special effects are nothing special at all - nothing we haven't seen a hundred times in the last 20 years.

I think it is getting a far worse rap than it deserves, in the scheme of things. They got some subtle science things right, and some things wrong, but that combination probably makes it ok in the genre.The best aspect was the performance and character of John Bradley (of Game of Thrones fame), as KC Houseman. Alternately funny and sympathetic. Had he not done his part, I would have enjoyed the movie much less.The epic disaster genre is always flawed, technically and otherwise.

I am 100% not joking about this! The fact that the Iron Sky Franchise even exists is bonkers!

And, I would recommend that when you read someones negative reviews on a film, you should go read their other reviews of other films to get an idea of what kind of thinker they are. There are many reviewers that like to write negative criticisms of other films decorated with fancy drivel to seem like some sort of an expert in film. When, in reality, it all boils down to personal preference and not every film should be graded by arthouse or criterion collection checklists. If youre judging modern movies by such strict guidelines youre probably not any fun to go to the theater with.As for the filmThe movie was quite good. It was better than I expected (due to how terrible most of the last 12 months films have actually been: carnage, the new matrix, the new resident evil, and the list goes on)The film was in fact better than I hoped. Perhaps my expectations were tainted by such poor productions in the last year but still.. this movie was everything I asked for and then some.Yes, there were a few silly actiony moments but what else do you really expect from a film like this where humanity isnt obliterated and the earth totally destroyed? You have to 'roll with it' on some of these types of films. Impossible car jumps, surviving disastrous situations on pure luck, all that is to be expected in this type of film. It is what it is.Outside of those moments, and what i feel tends to be subpar acting from HB, the rest of the film was a spectacular ride.There were enough scifi elements to scratch that itch. The CG looked quite good. There was an interesting (though not 100% original) twist/addition to the plot that I thought was appropriate and done well enough despite being perhaps predictable for some. BUT EVEN THEN: it was done well and still quite good.The only things that I would change about it would be a bit more time spent on the lore and history they give you in the film. And perhaps some extra bits of action regarding certain... pieces of technology... left behind that the main characters discover and acknowledge but ultimately ignore.And maybe some more exposition on the epilogue of the story. What was it like in the next decade or century after the events taking place, how did they handle the revelation and new knowledge about the moon.Even then, even missing that, the film was still a good watch, fun time, exciting, nice to look at, touched on decent plot points, and didnt consume a full day for nothing like many films to come out in the last 12 months.",0,1,/user/ur108265449/?ref_=tt_urv

tt5834426,ur103008948,3,6 February 2022,"Well... let's start from the beginning, this movie is bad. Wait, let me explain...
It's a movie that believes the moon is hollow, just because! I mean, it doesn't have any really motivation for that, logical or not, they just believe on a fake thing and wants the audience to believes it too. Motivation is the process that initiates someone to do something , in this case believe in a hollow on the moon, that is something i couldn't find anything to support this argument, not in the movie even outside. So, from the scratch this movie doesn't work.Hang on, there is more!This movie doesn't know what genre is. Sometimes it wants to be a comedy, thriller, action... but falls at everything. Cause this movie can't focus in anything, it just random, doesn't go deep in anything. Talking about deepness, i want to refer is the motivation that i wrote before, the past of the character (part of the character that makes a trace of personality of him). The comedy... Anyone laughs in my movie session, either do i. I think the reason is that the gags sounded like it was out of it's place. It's a serious movie (in general), so... why do i want to laugh in that? People dying, part of the moon was destroyed... I don't want to laugh in that.Another problem:This movie is too serious and edgy! Even the colors, dark blue and black (a lot of times). It does not have motive to use this color scheme, because it want to be a comedy and it not works on that kinda movie what is sci-fi (i think), it's more for (just) terror movies or (just) thriller, cause this kind of movies wants to scary me, Moonfall, not. The themes of discussion are really serious too, even it's a fake news (like i said before) and the exaggeration of it. Exaggerated movies are normally not taken too serious, like Borat, exaggerated, but not serious. In Moonfall the characters goes to the center of moon and it was like truth or really interesting, fot the characters it was WOW, but for me MEH, because was exaggerated and taken serious!Technical aspect:Cinematography does well to pass the message that move is serious (like i said before), focusing in emotions of the characters and not anything really creative like a long shot to make it subjective, just med shots for us to see the emotions of he characters. Editing do the same thing as well. And the VFX was the best part of the movie i really believed in (even if the characters does not interact with that). VFX had like 'ray tracing' in some parts, have secondary actions (Twelve basic principles of animation) which is good for the VFX of this movie, cause made the movie more believable. Even the 'ray tracing' makes more believable.Final opinion:If you want to see a movie with good Visual effects go see this movie!

In the climactic battle where Russell shows up to save the day by, ultimately, crashing his plane into the alien ship's superlaser and blowing it up, the original scene had him not in a fighter jet but his crop-dusting by plane, equipped with a missile strapped to the side. Now, part of the reason this scene was rewritten was because they thought it would be more impactful to have Russell realize in the moment that he had to sacrifice himself to save humanity, rather than planning it in advance. The other reason was someone told the director, ""No, this isn't going to work. It's just too hard to believe.""Well, apparently no one was telling Roland ""no"" on this one. Random conspiracy theorist discovers the moon is out of orbit before NASA? YES! NASA somehow gets a decommissioned space shuttle up and running in a matter of days at a fully-equipped launch pad conveniently located in California? YES! Crew relies on moon's enhanced gravitational pull to compensate for loss of engine in getting said space shuttle into orbit while launching out of a tidal wave? YES! Teenager launches a car into the sky and hops Mario-style across chunks of the earth's crust flying into the atmosphere and lands safely on the other side with a still functioning cross-over SUV? YES! Mankind spends decades and trillions of dollars developing space technology sophisticated enough to observe distant galaxies but somehow misses that our own moon is some kind of benign Death Star? YES! Giving your best acting recruit (Donald Sutherland) all of 90 seconds of screen time in an entirely pointless role? YES!I have to say, even with my severely managed expectations going into this movie, I was disappointed. Sure there were some fun moments and interesting concepts (which were cheated by cramming them into 2 minutes of subconscious exposition in the waning minutes of the movie), but that couldn't overcome the extreme suspension of disbelief one has to sustain, the titled dialogue, the cheesy humor, and at times bad acting (though that might be as much script as actors). Independence Day was fun and genuinely funny, and watching it you can't help developing an affection for the characters.

The graphics and visuals in the movie were a lot of fun to watch. It's not a comedy, but the ridiculousness and craziness of some of the things happening might make it seem like one to some people, but I think most of those people who call this a ""comedy"" just can't comprehend what's going on or are not big fans of these types of sci-fi movies. It's a family friendly movie for the most part and not meant to have that super serious vibe. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I can't really go into details, but the concepts in the movie and reasons why things are happening are not uncommon at all in many other space sci-fi movies. People going into this movie expecting it all to make sense by real world standards might have a harder time enjoying it. If you want the story to make sense, you need to be open minded and it will make sense. Just don't over think it, and you will probably enjoy it.

The scientific inaccuracies were a void of the corny fun typically seen in space dramas and instead were just downright insulting to the minds of the audience. Enjoyable dialogue was as nonexistent as lunar light during the New Moon. Any attempts at ""witty"" quips fell so short of the proverbial line that the movie would have been better off without them.

Of course the Earth was going to be saved by some unrealistic bomb in the core and everyone would live happily ever after in the 'new normal' Earth.There's also a subtle but unmistakable attempt at Chinese-propoganda, which makes sense given that this is a Chinese made and funded movie. The main family have a Mandarin-speaking house maid who seems to be the only relatable, smart character in the movie. Of course she saves the family towards the end.

The miniatures in the disaster scenes looked like middle school dioramas, and all the actors besides the stars were so bad it made me want to throw a brick through the screen.I'm pretty sure the black guy that was the military general was blind, like literally a blind actor, as his eyes were wonky and he consistently faced the wrong direction when he talked to people.My girl asked me as the credits started to roll, 'Can you explain to me what I just watched?'

Years before when astronauts, Patrick Wilson & Halle Berry, experienced an event which caused the death of one of their comrades & damage to their shuttle, NASA in turn, disregarding what we have seen, cuts its ties w/Wilson attributing his handling of the incident to gross negligence. When a megastructuralist (an area of science he coined), played by Games of Thrones' John Bradley, manages to gain access to the portentous news (he pretends to be a college professor), he mounts an effort to contact Wilson (now relegated to doing speaking engagements at the Griffin Observatory for school kids) but is escorted from the property before pleading his case. Hoping to investigate the lunar phenomenon, NASA launches a spacecraft only for the three person crew to be killed by a black tentacle (confirming Wilson's version of events from before) prompting for our triumvirate of heroes; Wilson, Berry & Bradley to pool their resources & information in order to stop the unthinkable. Feeling like what should've been the Independence Day sequel, the film embraces the stupid in such a way the receiver is out of breath & the viewer just slaps their foreheads in disbelief at the destination this story takes us. Never boring w/the CGI fairly well done (but isn't that pretty much the norm in this day & age), the film would probably play better w/o dialogue but w/the sound effects played to your cinema's sound systems breaking point. Also starring Michael Pena as the hubby of Wilson's ex-wife, Donald Sutherland as mister information dump, Charlie Plummer as Wilson's estranged son & Kelly Yu playing Berry's au pair (but I suspect her casting was due to the backing Chinese production company insisting an Asian star for foreign markets).",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur28936021/?ref_=tt_urv

Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) has been arrested for being a fake rich German aristocrat in the New York ultra-rich world. Pregnant disgraced reporter Vivian Kent (Anna Chlumsky) fights to investigate her convoluted story.It's money. It's lies. It's a story of New York hustling. It has the potential for some deep dive into the mind of a serial faker and desperate hustler. Instead, Shonda does a simple night swim in those waters. That's not to say that she doesn't do anything with the darker material underneath Anna. Garner's obviously-fake flat voice also frustrated me a little although I understand the need for an obviously-fake accent with this character. In many ways, Shonda is making this show about Vivian and leaving Anna as a more unknowable person. It's probably the safer choice but it does leave me wondering if I actually care about anything happening to Anna in one or two of the episodes.

You couldn't have asked for a better casting choice. What amazed me was how easily Anna managed to scam everyone around her, apparently believing in the delusional character she created for herself. That delusion surfaced in an exceedingly narcissistic character who didn't care who she bamboozled or hurt along the way. Especially effective is the episode where Anna travels to Morocco with a retinue of followers who all believe they're vacationing on her dime, while she attempts to juggle phone calls, wire transfers and stalling tactics in an effort that eventually resulted in one of her 'friends' shelling out payment for a sixty two thousand dollar hotel bill!

Except the parts that are totally made up."" We then go to ""November 20, 2017"" as Anna Delvey is charged in a New York court with various crimes and remanded to Rikers Island. In a parallel story line, we are introduced to Vivian Kent, a struggling writer at Manhattan Magazine and who happens to be pregnant with her first child. She pitches the idea of doing a deep dive on this Anna Delvey to the magazine, and goes off to Rikers to meet Anna in person. At this point we are 15 min into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this is the latest brainchild from Shonda Rhimes (""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Bridgeton""). Here she uses an article from New York magazine to bring a sprawling look at the real life story of this mysterious Anna Delvey a/k/a Anna Sorokin. Who is she? A German heiress with unlimited funds from her trust? A skilled con woman out to connive Manhattan's high society? Both? More? This mini-series spares no expenses, and we get a lot of ""the life styles of the rich and famous"" type stuff. And Julia Garner (""Ozark"") is terrific in the lead role. But two things hold this mini-series back: first, I am bothered by the disclaimer that opens each episode that ""all is true, except where it isn't"". So what this means is that we have no idea what parts are based on the real life story of Anna Delvey, and what is ""totally made up"". Second, at a running time of almost 10 hours, the mini-series is too long for its own good. Leave out the fluff, and instead it should've made a terrific 3 or 4 part mini-series.

You know me. Everyone knows me. I'm an icon "" we know this character is going interesting.I wish the Producers had listened to the opening statement from Anna Delvey because this overlong over produced series is padded too much with journalist Vivien Kent's domestic life and her obsession to clear her reputation with Anna's story and the chase to get Anna's victims to contribute to it . I'm not diminishing Anna Chlumsky's performance she's very good but her character is over blown and I feel slows up this really interesting story.Anna Delvey is a fascinating baffling woman who it's difficult to have any empathy or sympathy with.I'm still not sure if she is just a narcissist, a functional alcoholic with a bi polar disorder or a schizophrenic or perhaps just a woman with a dissociative identity disorder or a combination of all?She is obviously intelligent but has no charm or sophistication or interest in anyone but herself and her dreams. She reminds me of a Kardashian without funds and a gift of the gab who managed to excel at networking and gaining entry into the fashionable and super wealthy New York Social set . Somehow she managed to look a million dollars and one thing she did have was a great sense of fashion that she cultivated from her childhood scrapbooks in Russia and Germany.The fashions and locations are beautiful to watch and the ensemble cast are all splendid I just wish the script did justice to Julia Gardiner's portrayal of Anna Delvey which is reason enough to watch this overlong over padded 9 part series.Anna Delvey now 31 is currently being held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Custody in Upstate New York after being released from Prison after serving four years .

Anna Sorokin aka Anna Delvey (played by the extraordinary Julia Garner) was charged with various counts of larceny and other crimes, and in April 2019 found guilty of eight of them. But what a wild ride she had. You will enjoy every minute of the 9 episodes. The pace of the story, the characters involved, the dialogues and the mystery? Even after watching the first episodes you are still not sure who is telling the truth and who isn´t. Just as good, in a naturally less showy part, is Anna Chlumsky as journalist Vivian Kent. Her character is based on the writer Jessica Pressler, whose article about Delvey in New York magazine after her arrest brought Anna to the world's attention, much to the humiliation of the defrauded banks, art collectors, gallery owners, fashionistas and socialites who wanted their embarrassing gullibility swept under the carpet.). The story keeps moving back and forth between Kent's interviews with Anna in prison. ""Why do you dress like that?"" asks Anna with a characteristic blend of contempt and concern. ""You look poor"" etc. Her investigations and scenes that show how Anna got from there (a working-class town outside Moscow) to here (Rikers Island prison), via London, Paris and New York. Obsessed boyfriends, intimidated hoteliers and businesswomen who use her as a maid and don't check their statements lead to bigger and better frauds. Until, that is, the little giveaways lead to greater suspicions, betrayed friends amass grievances that need expression, and eventually the queen of grifters is unmasked and imprisoned.

The writing is about as subtle as a claw hammer slammed into drywall, and most of the acting is just as over-the-top awful, especially Anna Chlumsky as reporter Vivian Kent.Julia Garner is fine as the title character, a shameless young con artist who ripped off several young Manhattan residents, restaurants, shops and ritzy hotels in her quest to live the good life as a faux heiress/art entrepreneur.

Know that Anna was the one behind this series deal, SHE'S the one who profited from it, to the amount of $300,000 (minus $224,000 in restitution, so she left prison, early, $76,000 richer than before). So a few of Anna's crimes or ""sins"" got moved onto Rachel here. Explains a lot of the murky excuses or justifications for what Anna did, as Anna was running this series. Just despicable. Changing rating from 5* to 1*.So 12+hrs of a series to tell 45min of a news feature. So, of course it's slow and plodding. Muddy and murky. Messages and justifications that it's just our society and since powerful people don't go to jail, why is poor, poor Anna. Yes, let's not fix the system, but excuse all crimes because the system is not equal. In many cases, that has some merit, but not here, not for someone so horrible and outright GUILTY. Anna used her thefts, odd baby looks and ""charm"" (or bullying), with a certain privilege, to get away with this as long as she did and as far as she got.This series was badly written, with a horrible story arc, as it essentially wrapped up in ep 7 and the story arc pointed that way, but Shonda Rhimes began a whole new season when she continued into the legal battle. Also, trying to show what in Anna's past caused her to do these things was very muddled, slow, and never justified her behavior or made me feel anything for her, beyond contempt. So ep 8 and 9, and most of 7 were very hard to get through, as I felt it was done to death and wrapped up already.Acting was fairly ok, except for the Vivian and defense lawyer being over the top melodramatic rather than relying on their skills. The actress who played Anna had a striking resemblance to the real Anna, and was very effective, but in that, also had NO redeeming qualities or reasons why she did what she did (but quite a lot of screen time was spent on trying to find out, which feel flat). By the end, many of the characters were so unlikable and frustrating that it wasn't worth it.Hard to believe that Shonda Rhimes was behind this. It had none of the wonderful wit of Bridgerton (granted, that was the best of most of her filmography that I have seen, so...this was 90% expected, now that I think about it). And certainly had none of the production values of Bridgerton. The plot also relied on tired stereotypes like ""reporter's boss doesn't want girl reporter to do this story"", and reporter has to fight, sneak, and convince him bla bla bla. Rhimes should have hired better writers or forced rewrites of this laziness.Lot of messages here. I thought the ""males and females who screw up are treated differently"" message was good and one that I have certainly lived, which gets little attention in the media that other inequalities, but it could have been handled much better. I guess all the messages could have, then they would have been palatable, instead of turned off the very people who were supposed to nod their heads, like me, not to mention the other ""side"", who are no doubt still raging over them.This was supposed to come off very tongue in cheek and funny at times, like Bridgerton, but it just fell flat, and the actors couldn't pull it off. I'm getting weary of NF's original content that almost reaches a high enough bar, but never actually delivers, dragging the viewer though needless jell-o, and charging us more for it now.

Julia Garner. Is a real fire cracker of an actress in Ozark. But in Inventing Anna, not so much. A southern accent is one of the easiest to imitate and Garner pulls it off like a champ in Ozark. But her accent in Inventing Anna is imposingly inauthentic and very distracting. If a good accent coach could not have fixed her delivery, then she should not have been cast in the role. I think producers and the casting director were trying to cash in on Garner's success in Ozark. But ultimately she was miscast in the process.

And the husband behaves like an elderly grandmother. I have to question if anyone in the writer's room has actually ever had a relationship, as no-one seems to relate to anyone in a normal, believable way.I really thought we were all done with that whole ""rich girl who loves shoes , clothes and walks around with shopping bags"" trope but it accounts for 25% of this series, which is just plain lazy character writing. But lazy writing is the order of the day here and there are so many painful, contradictory moments.One highlight was Vivian's agony over her career when viewing the ultrasound. As a 41 year old woman you would have thought she might be happy that the baby appears normal. And in what news office does everyone sit around drinking coffee and gasbagging like the aged cast of Four Weddings and a Funeral? Also, Anna bangs on about misogyny and all that, while ripping off elderly women and treating Vivian like a peasant.As for the music, it's pretty rare to find a series that actually misuses the soundtrack but that's what's going on here.

tt8740976,ur24655869,1,15 February 2022,"Accents are hard (and most actors not named Meryl should probably steer clear of them). Unless they are mastered to the point where they are forgotten (so that the task of interpretation and portrayal can take place) what we get instead is acting as clumsy and unfocused as a writer's first draft. Since the actor's mind is still partly distracted by the accuracy of the sounds they are attempting, the performance cannot transform into a fully realized human. Similar to acting when you haven't learned your lines: you may have moments of inspiration, but mostly you're struggling to remember, and great acting takes place in the magical arena where all the concentration and practice can be gently discarded so that something authentic and inspired can rise and transform into the fully lived.Julia Garner may have leaned heavily into her Missouri twang on ""Ozark"" but it was a great fit. And she brought a level of truth and humor and pathos (and rage) to the role.On ""Inventing Anna,"" the weird (not in a good way) Netflix series, Julia is clearly struggling. The accent is like a slippery live trout she's trying to hang onto. Every now and then she gets a firm grip on that sucker. But the next second it flops right out of her hand. And when she loses the thread she goes from great actress to community theatre newbie in a matter of seconds, and it's heartbreaking to watch.I spent some time listening to the real Anna Sorokin speaking via YouTube clips, and she does have a strange accent: Part Russian, part German and occasionally Swedish (?) but since she's lived with that weird soup for long enough it sounds natural coming from her. But I think even Meryl would've found this particular assignment daunting.It's too bad that Shonda Rimes didn't take the time to pull Julia aside and say ""This isn't quite working yet."" Though they've clearly tried to mitigate the damage in post by cutting around her performance as much as possible, the unfortunate result being that Anna Chlumsky becomes the default center of the movie and she is mortifyingly miscast in the role of reporter.I had never seen anything by Shonda Rimes before, so I have no idea whether ""Inventing Anna"" is indicative of her work. But it may be the most PreFab piece of entertainment ever made. It's like a Mad Libs version of a TV Show:
Two lines of dialogue (INSERT PLOT POINT)
Three lines of dialogue (INSERT LAME JOKE)
Another line of dialogue (REPEAT LAME JOKE)
Three lines of dialogue (GET SERIOUS FOR A MOMENT)
Two lines of dialogue (DROP A BOWLING BALL ON THE AUDIENCE)
And then repeat, repeat, repeat.I'm not kidding: by ten minutes in I was able to recite, along with the actors, almost word for word, exactly what they were about to
say. It is a Swanson's TV dinner disguised as a miniseries:
Here's a bite of turkey and gravy,
now some mashed potatoes,
how about some peas?Here's the apple brown Betty...
There is nothing coming down the pike that you didn't see on the tray when you took off the foil. Yummy. And no thanks.Julia will recover from this debacle. There are moments when her trademark rage breaks through the wall of vocal nonsense (Natasha/Frau Blucher/Swedish Chef Muppet) and we can see what might have been.But what to make of Shonda Rimes? Apparently this sort of entertainment is much in demand. I know her doctor show has been on the air since World War II; and far be it from me to take an artistic swing at someone who can land a $100 million dollar deal from Netflix.

My only gripe is the accent which is really grinds through you. Would be interesting to know how the real Anna talks.Other than that the other characters are mostly repulsive. Anna Chlumsky in particular leads the line of melodrama and over acting. Id say she probably clocked a record for the number of facial expressions in any given scene in tv history.It didnt need 10hrs to tell the story. I think it would have been more effective in half the time.Soundtrack was solid.All in all a fairly average affair that will have you yawning and rolling your eyes on plenty of occasions as the show stumbles its way through plot milestones.,unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur36129748/?ref_=tt_urv

tt8740976,ur1918986,3,22 February 2022,"Julia Garner is remarkable, balancing dark satire and grim malignance, but everything else about this is degenerate and confused. It features histrionic acting, a fantastically over-written, incoherent script, chronic dance music meant to animate ice-stiff banality in a film with no dancing, and a fundamental refusal to judge a character who is clearly, in many scenes, dangerous and delusional. Did the directors start to use aromatic drugs as this went on? Especially in its poison-long final third, the film shifts into a reading of the protagonist that sounds like an 8th grader's platitudes about the Great Gatsby and ""the American Dream"" based not on a reading of the novel but of an on-line summary that the sleepless 13-year old essayist misunderstood. The film's incidental agenda to depict men as some variation of nebbishy, brutal, credulous, and silly (change the order to define any man in the miniseries; e.g., x = ""a brutally silly, credulous nebbish"" or y = ""a nebbishly silly, credulous brute"") is a tedious distraction that further dilutes the drama of this story.

Unfortunately, I found the character of Anna, originally intriguing, evolving of into being unappealing, thoughtless materialistic and self-centered at anybody else's cost. Her accent was more snobbish than foreign, often sounding like the put on and pretentious tone of a "" valley girl."" Although Anna was a sad, disturbed character, I couldn't feel sorry for her to the end when she was convicted after trial of some of the 10 counts against her especially since she exploited her friend Rachel to the tune of $60k.I felt the character of the journalist, Vivian, went downhill and became ridiculous the more she got personally connected with Anna which was actually a conflict of interest in her role of writing an objective magazine article about her. In fact it was so absurd that she gave Anna a much publicized white dress to wear during the trial. I also found her aspect to be overly expressive with emotion that seemed out of place.As to Anna's lawyer, he should have given up on her long ago since she was so obnoxious and impossible to handle. Furthermore, I felt it was unrealistic for him to jeopardize his marriage by suddenly telling his wife right after the trial that he wasn't leaving with her and their children on the rare family vacation they were taking to Mexico that day. Instead he went back to see Anna in her jail cell at court. Really??!!!Having said all that, I felt the acting in general was superb, especially Anna's regardless of what I thought about the character(s) .

The characters are more like caricatures. The soundtrack plays like someone who is completely out of touch chose songs they thought were ""bops"".

It feels like a 13 year old wrote it. The whole show makes it seem as if theres more to Anna than there is when in the end...she's just a super flat character who is a scammer with nothing going for her. If it was maybe written and casted properly...and if it was shorter.... I think it would have done better. Instead, we got an actress playing Anna while putting on the WORST fake accent and having the most annoying attitude and voice ever. How is anyone supposed to sympathize with this character when she is 1. Very stupid 2. Thinks she's very smart 3. Is fooling people into believing her schemes in the dumbest, most unintelligent, and most unconvincing ways possible to the point that no real person would ever fall for it, and 4. Has no personality or true background story to make us understand or like her.Also the other characters in the show are super dumb as well and make decisions nobody in real life would ever do. Everybody is also incredibly overdramatic and theres no one worth rooting for. I don't see how anybody would be on Annas side or sympathize with her at all in this story nor do I think any dialogue in this show comes off as ""deep"" like I think the writer wanted it be. She was just a really lame scammer who only got that far because everyone around her ... including upper-class banks and expensive New York lawyers....were all somehow dumber (this is also totally unrealistic by the way...the way they fell for everything so easily is just laughable). For example; Imagine telling a $1000/hour lawyer to work all these long free hours for you and getting them to do it by just saying you have a $60 million trust fund. You think they'd work all those hours without ever seeing a dime of it? Yeah no, doesn't happen....except in this show lol.Anyway, interesting story line whether it's true or not, but bad everything else in my opinion. Everyone in this movie has about 2 brain cells each.

My wife speaks German and has lived in Germany and says it sounds authentic, but I think the point of it is that it sounded nondescript European to an American ear. It was a scam after all, so it didn't have to be overly accurate.The series runs for 10 hours which is about 5 hours too long in my opinion. I have no idea why American TV loves to draw things out so much. Keep it shorter. Keep it punchy. But each episode looks at the perspective from each of the main players in Anna's life. So while the story plays out, there is a lot of time line look backs which work, but it's kind of done to death throughout the series.I liked most of the characters, but I didn't love Vivian (Anna Chlumsky) so much. Overly frantic and annoying. Alexis Floyd as Neff was brilliantly played.But I won't lie, the best bits were Anna's withering put downs, she is like the voice we wish we all had at the right time to say it. The dialogue at these moments was really great and Julia Garner delivers them with relish. I love how, no matter how much she is confronted by overwhelming evidence to the contrary, she manages to flip the conversation and make even the viewer doubt their own sanity.The whole show revolves around a promise of confidence. Much like the 1954 film The Million Pound Note, starring Gregory Peck, where the mere fact of holding a piece of paper that says you are worth so much, affords you luxury and the opening of doors and bows and scrapes. It gives food for thought as to how we view the social order in today's world, but I'm sure that like me, most viewers will have admired the vision Anna had, and will have also wondered just how this story would have played out if that investment in ADF had actually been made.",0,1,/user/ur103505583/?ref_=tt_urv

tt8740976,ur65707638,7,23 February 2022,"The good parts:Anna's story in general was interesting and the parts in which we get to watch her doing her con things are ones that I enjoyed watching (not from a moral perspective of course, but from a viewer perspective it was an interesting watch). These specific parts are also pretty much what I intended and assumed I'll watch when I started watching this series. Overall I found myself still looking forward to know what more will happen, which in my opinion is the most important thing when I watch TV.The acting level in most cases is really good.The series keeps telling you that some things are real and some are made up, however at no point it is telling you what was real and what was made up. After a personal research I can say that at least MOST things you can look up seem accurate enough, and nothing too shocking or game changing about the parts that were not accurate, at least according to what you can find online. The made-up parts to my impression seem to be mostly for the non-Anna related parts, so overall I don't feel like I wasted my time watching something far from reality.However, there were a few issues too:There was WAY and I mean WAY too much focus on the journalist. I honestly didn't care much about her average personal life issues, or the struggles she went through to slowly discover the story, or her work state and relationship with her co-workers (that isn't even accurate to real life), or her pregnancy and life at home. Majority of it also seem to be completely made up scenes based on a few general true facts. That whole storyline was just plain boring and is not what we came to watch, which in general would be fine as a secondary story, but in this case instead of it being a seconary back story it is often treated as the MAIN storyline, with Anna's story being the secondary one (to a point where the journalist is even credited before the actress who played Anna, as if the journalist is the main character of this series). I honestly would have much rathered watch a normal story from beginning to end and only meet the journalist at the end of it. I wouldn't mind 9 episodes if it was all actually relevant to the story I came to watch, but the filler content here just completely took over the main storyline, and that filler content wasn't even an interesting one to begin with.The fake accent was just too fake. While Julia Garner's acting is great, the accent does not pass at all and throws you off from the very first moment. I get that it was a challenging one as it is a mix of a few different accents, but at the end of the day it just didn't sound genuine, it sounded like a person trying to mimic a fake accent on purpose. It would have been better to just drop the accent completely and let Julia talk like she normally does.As the episodes progress, it feels more and more like this was made by someone who adores Anna, probably even a fan of hers. I came out of watching it thinking Anna is kinda cool after all, which is a little concerning considering this is a series about a criminal con artist. Yet, there was some clear and extreme effort here by the makers of this series to make sure I'll feel that way.

It starts a bit slow but it does become intriguing which I felt kept me watching otherwise I would have turned off. With that, I'm glad I kept watching. You get to see a real life fake entrepreneur and how she fakes all the money she can whilst holding hope to gain 1 or more loans from big companies/banks. Also you get to see how this happened and how she managed to make friends in high places that made her a ""known"" name. It shouldn't be impossible to happen but Anna manages to fool everyone she met and screwed many of them over to gain money or at least a ""name"" for herself. It's helped by a failing journalist that tells the story and also reports on it at the same time. Which mixes in her story.Look, it's not amazing. It's a real life story that is made up in places as the show tells you at every beginning but it's fascinating at the same time. Some of the biggest banks were giving her stupid money off her looks alone. It shows you can manipulate certain higher powers but also shows the reality of the consequences.Acting: Julia Garner was fantastic at playing a rich, spoilt young lady with her head up her butt. She was great like as she was in Dirty John and certainly Ozark. The accent which is supposed to be German ( you'll see why in the show ) is a little bit...bad. Maybe that's because of the reasons stated in the show. I'll let you all decide. Others acting have done really well, I never felt we were let down. But there are a few points that needed addressing.These being: length of each show. An hour or more is just too long. It can happily run on 9 episodes with 40m a go.The accent: Julia is clearly a good good actress but German or Russian doesn't sound like that. It's a weird half warped accent.The lies: we know it's not all true. It says so at the beginning of every episode. But some of it is so fictional, I'd say it's a joke to watch.

By trying to keep it ""realistic"" it's confusing.I did enjoy it but I wanted more watching it and didn't really care for the pregnancy of Vivian, because I wanted to watch a psycho stealing money from people born into wealth who do stuff us middle class people rarely experience. We see her looking at a bill for 27000 , people on yachts and we do get some dialogue about class from Todd (Annas lawyer) about feeling like a fish out of water but his wife is just like ""so sorry you were poor"".

The real Anna was paid $320,000 for her story and you can tell that this is HER story. When it comes down to it, whatever her reasons were, this woman is a con-artist and shouldn't be celebrated. But where at first you're horrified by the things she does, by the last episode the writers are making it seem that she's a misunderstood genus and the poor friend she ripped off for $60k is a laughable hypocrite. Let's not lose sight of who the real sociopath is here. I don't know Rachel Williams, but the last episode of this series made me ill with the snide comments from the lawyer and the snarky looks from the journalist and her best friend in the background. Yeah, maybe she profited from the situation, but Rachel is a real person who got screwed and Shonda made fun of her like she was the criminal.

Like many trials and news I read the article and thought "" oh yeah?"" and before I had time to research this, COVID came, amongst many things.Fast forward to now.Julie Garner, who got my undivided attention in Ozark, came out as the lead in "" Inventing Anna"".What a riveting story.I was glued to the screen for 10 hours with only a few breaks to live my life.I was a bit annoyed that there was so much focus on the pregnancy of Vivian, the journalist played by Anna Chlomsky as it was not meant to be her story.Now that I read the credits, I note the series were based on the reporting and book by Ms Pressler who is the Vivian in the series. So, I guess, she wanted to draw attention to herself and not just play 2nd fiddle.I don't care much for the series, Chlomsky, the script and the story telling - if I did it myself, I would have done it differently.BUT this story is the best con since ""Catch Me if You Can"".It's not just ""let's do a Tinder Swindle"" - the brain and imagination of this young, 20 something, woman was mesmerising.Narcissistic, deluded, grandiose, selfish and criminal.You name it.What a ballsy act to con proper high game bankers and financiers of New York.I don't condone this, nor how she treated her friends, but I admire her intellect.Guys, there is so much in this story.Psychology of friendships, trust, desires, elite inner workings... and conning people.As I watched it, I was asking myself: surely she must have known her days were counted. But it was as the counsellor said: she believed that she needed to fake it and she was this 👌 close to making it.I couldn't sleep last night. I needed to analyse this, look for holes. I didn't find any.It just blew my mind.Julie Garner with her different accents - Russian, German and American - nailed it. I wasn't seeing the actress.

I seriously want to strangle Anna Chlumsky's character after watching this. Not sure if they told her to be as irritating as possible or if that was just her take, but holy crap there are literally no redeeming qualities to her at all. Julia Garner is great in her role and, while the accent is irritating, it's true to the person she was playing. Really wish someone other than Shonda Rhimes had produced this as it could have turned out much better. In its current form it plays out more like what the producers think women in their 20s want to watch rather than the rest of us.

I agree with other reviewers that it's too long. I also cannot understand why people like Anna. I don't understand why they're friends with her, why they are so loyal to her, or why the journalist, Vivian, is rooting for her. This woman depicted in the show is a sociopathic con-artist, and I do not sympathize with her. However, I do sympathize with Vivian and especially Rachel. Rachel was right in the way she handled things! Lucky for her she was able to make some money off of a traumatic ""friendship.""",0,2,/user/ur58574608/?ref_=tt_urv
tt8740976,ur59315391,6,12 February 2022,"Unlike a number of reviewers here, I didn't mind Julia Garner's accent - loved it in Ozark, and understood what she was going for here. Some undecipherable blend of all the character of Anna was, and pretended to be. When it comes to creating a tempo, building a story - from one episode to another, they did a pretty decent job. I was entertained, it passed the am-I-reaching-to-my-phone test.I was aware of the real story prior. Not just heard *of* it, but read quite a bit of the details. Some choices seem questionable. Why portray Rachel as an intolerable wannabe social climber that used Anna for money then sold her out? I honestly never understood that hollier-thsn-though approach that they took there... They made Nef's character an insufferable idiot (with this one I think they imagined they were doing the opposite... *facepalm*)
Why was the whole tone so childish and simplistic and lacked any nuance? Every majpr character was rooting for Anna to be announced not guilty and set free? After conning her alleged best friend out of an incredible amount of money that could cost her her job and possibly get her into legal trouble as well? Her trying to hold Anna accountable and make the best out of her situation is somehow moraly corrupt by their book? I don't understand...
Beyond that it was also riddled with unnecessary political jabs and all sorts of trite woke-isms that felt condescending and lecture-y while also managing to be really dumb and out of the blue.Felt like it could be explored a bit further. For such long episodes, way more time was spent on filler nonsense (the reporter is pregnant did you hear?) and way too little on the actual conning, life of the elite, juicy details about Anna's day-to-day and interactions. You know, what the title would suggest this is about. Maybe they rushed to get this done.",2,4,/user/ur59315391/?ref_=tt_urv

tt8740976,ur60338686,3,23 February 2022,"The story was decent, although it felt dragged out too long - 7 or 8 episodes would have been far better in my opinion. However, the mostly decent story was unredeemably overshadowed by two factors. The first was the acting. Although some of the cast did very well, there were a number of weak links that would be noticeably bad even in a low-budget indie film. Perhaps the characters are simply a result of poor casting - not every actor is meant to play every role, after all. But it's bad. Oh, goodness, it's so bad. It's so bad that I don't even want to single anyone out. Suffice to say, they were main characters. I'll move on.The second factor is: what the HECK is up with the random political jabs? It's like in almost every episode, they'll be having a conversation about one thing, and then out of nowhere someone will say something against Trump. Like, CLEARLY for the sole reason that they want to remind everyone in each episode that the filmmakers hate Trump. Which is fine, hate Trump if you want, he's certainly not my favorite either - but why compromise the integrity of your script with random political rabbit trails that lend nothing to the story or the characters? Shame on the writers. Shame on the casting director. Shame on Shonda for not having higher standards after the brilliance she's achieved in the past.

But I love the actress in Ozark and thought she did a good job. I kept watching because I wanted to learn more about this interesting character. I didn't know anything about Anna before this show, but it had me looking her up online to know more about her. I can see why the journalist and lawyer cared for her despite her awful personality towards them.

I have to hope it's in the writing and direction and that the actress is a delightful human and talented performer - but every time she appears I cringe - the dreadful Viv has one gear - obnoxious, shrill, and manic. Zero nuance, no moments of awareness (or interest) of/in anyone but herself, no real engagement with anyone at all. Yeah, we get that she's stressed - we've been there, no?

All of those scenes (the flashbacks of Anna pre-jail) were well acted and well produced - I'd give those an 8/10. What bothered me is how in the later episodes the show took a direction of sympathy towards Anna and tried to make the audience feel bad for her - like c'mon - she was an awful person taking advantage of other awful people who's intentions were fueled by their own greed and/or desire to be associated w/ the type of people who think they are better than everyone else. Even the regular people were still out to get free stuff and elevate their social status in the same ways. Didn't feel bad for any of them - even the girl who had the 60K vacation on her credit cards (shouldn't have went somewhere so out of her league financially to begin with and definitely shouldn't have given them her credit cards).Plus this whole storyline of the reporter's pregnancy was unneeded and just sad - they could have just left all that out and saved an episode or two. Also the wife of the lawyer all upset about the vacation - so weird and unnecessary - like the guy has a huge case he worked on for months and she's all upset and threatening divorce cause he can't go on vacation on a certain date? The personal lives of the reporter and lawyer just should have been cut out - they had enough drama and storyline just focusing on their professional stuff (like the reporters reputation struggle was enough), didn't need to bring their families into things.

The thing is that the money boosts their values but it was never theirs. My suggestion is that stay away from those girls unless you make easy money and are rich. Girls like Anna who use their intelligence to take short cut will never understand the success and hardship that regular and honest people have to go through.

tt8740976,ur2567938,8,22 February 2022,"I enjoyed Inventing Anna. At first, I wasn't that interested in binging it, but a few things swayed me. First, I thoroughly enjoyed Julia Garner as Ruth Langmore in Ozark and am excited to see her future acting endeavors. Secondly, I enjoy Shonda Rhimes's work - specifically Scandal and HTGAWM, so I figured it'd be decent. I was right. I also find it funny that a bulk of the negative reviews come from people who stopped at two episodes or fast forwarded through the series. Those review should be null and void IMO, because how can your review truly be valid if you didn't even watch tht whole series? But I digress. The show is good. If you're a Shonda fan, there are moments that are starkly her - cc: Nell and Vivian's discussion about what she really wants in episode one. I thought Olivia Pope was talking at one point, but remembered who this work was tied to. Julia does a great job playing her role, but the accent is definitely cringeworthy. It's horrible. It was probably my least favorite thing of the whole show. Aside from that, Anna Chlumsky annoyed me on occasion, but that is probably because of how her character is portrayed/how she chose to portray her. All in all, it's worth a binge, but I do think it kind of dragged on after episode six. If you are fan of Scandal, it was like a mini reunion as quite a few familiar faces popped up in this show. I read up on Anna (Soronkin) Delvy after, and a number of the characters were real and a good part of the story is too.

Also, we the viewer are bluntly told at the beginning of every episode that some, none, or all of this is fake/real - so why the hell should I care about anything or anyone in the series? The characters are all unlikeable. They are all let down by an awful script and direction. I'll be avoiding anything else that Shonda Rhimes name pops up in. I loved Julia Garner in Ozark, but her talent is sadly wasted in this shambles of a show. Inventing Anna (9 episodes) is 8 episodes too long. This could have been a slightly better 90min film, at best. Like most average people out there, I was mildly interested in the real Anna Delvey story when it blew up in the news and social media, and then quickly I didn't care one bit and forgot about it.

Shonda did what Shonda does. She invented her own version of Anna Delvey. She paints Anna as a folk hero with a message that it's ok to steal as long as it's from rich people, banks or people who ""deserve"" it. Worse, that Anna's crimes greatly benefited victims. She injects so much needless social and political statements throughout this series. There's enough fluff you can fast forward without concern for missing vital scenes. She tries to argue that girls just wanna have fun and social justice in more important. Anna Sorokin is a real criminal who committed real crimes.If you are watching this because you like Julia Garner, unfortunately she isn't enough to balance the weight of horrible writing, casting and acting. The show places a majority of the characters in the ""self serving"" category, intended or not.

The ratings were lower than I would have preferred but I loved the trailer, and the cast made me want to give it a shot.Julia Garner and Anna Chlumsky are fantastic. So is Arian. Julia could have skipped the accent but you get used to it. Just like you got used to her Dirty John accent. I hear she is fantastic on Ozark too but I haven't watched it yet.I was loving Inventing Anna. I was shocked that the ratings could be under 7. I was finding it very entertaining, engaging and exciting. Then suddenly from episode 8 onwards the show started becoming something of an Anna sympathy fest. Guys, she's a con-artist! Selfish, delusional, sociopathic and downright disrespectful of everyone in her life. Her fashion sense, her ""dreams"", her ""ambition"" shouldn't make us feel like what she did or how she is, is cool. If she was really as ""hardworking"" as she claims, she would have actually done the groundwork instead of spending people's monies on buying an expensive lifestyle.Why does Vivian Kent get manipulated like that ? Why doesn't she think that Anna deserved the prison sentence she got? I feel like the show lost the plot. Vivian Kent questions at one point if she's a con too. I guess both the character and the show aren't interesting in finding the answer to that. Why are grown journalists rooting for Anna to get not-guilty verdict? Why does it feel like the show tries to tell us that ""it's okay. Whatever Anna did was just a little girl dreaming big."" Not buying that.In the end, the show went from being engaging, interesting and exciting to irritating and filled with lots of unlikeable characters (Special mention to the character of Neff).

All that rhetoric about her being a young girl in a big bad men's world to justify her actions makes me sick to my stomach.They even go as far as victim-blaming everyone she conned, specially Rachel.

tt8740976,ur149680291,2,18 February 2022,"It boggles my mind that the new hit Netflix miniseries, made with all the budget and resources in the world, could be this terrible. It feels insulting. First of all, the acting is terrible. Every single actor in this show, with the exception of maybe Laverne Cox, is so inorganic and not genuine that it hurts. Every character feels forced. Based on these performances, they belong in higher tier community theatre, not the #1 Netflix show in the country. Do the show runners know they could have afforded good actors? The main character, Vivian, is particularly cringy to watch. I don't remember the actor's name, and I don't want to. All her emotion is played out on her face in an over dramatic, pandering way. It's not acting, it's indication and gesticulation to give the *illusion* of acting. The same can be said for most everyone in the show. Subtlety and nuance are thrown out the window, and it's maddening. Second, the format is unbearable. Not only are the episodes FAR too long (over an hour each), but letting the plot unfold through the lens of a journalist investigating the case means it takes FOREVER for the audience to learn anything important. It's very frustrating to have to force yourself to stay interested in a show that drags on this way, like it feels entitled to your time and knows you're gonna sit there no matter what. Third, the writers have done that writer thing where they have forgotten how actual humans talk. Many of the lines are run on, cleverly worded sentences that would never be said in a normal conversation. They're trying to be witty and relatable, but not real. And the actors certainly aren't good enough to pull it off, so it's even more obvious.Everything in this show, down to the music choices, is forced. It feels like it's trying too hard to be the next big show everyone's obsessed with, when it's really a bad soap opera using the reputation of ""Netflix miniseries"" to trick you into thinking you're watching something intelligent. It had everything going for it: a fascinating true story, experienced show runners, and a freaking Netflix budget, so I simply can't understand how the final product was this: pandering, surface-level drivel.

I have to say that the series did nothing but disappoint. The real story is hidden behind the political agendas of the writers and Director. There's one scene in particular that goes to shows complete hypocrisy and that any story line within this mess of a series can and will be altered to fit a political narrative. This is a scene where two characters are on the street, one is a black woman and one is a white woman. The Black woman is accusing a white woman of being bought by Anna. The clothes, shoes and purse that the white woman is wearing are all paid for by Anna. When the white woman says to the black woman that the same thing happened with her (with Anna patrolling the blank woman) the black woman immediately starts screaming at the top of her lungs about how she dares the white woman to say that she was ""bought"" as a black woman again. It's this kind of hypocrisy that is buried in this show (subtly and not so subtly) that makes it completely unenjoyable. Not only that but they throw in political scenes and references that have absolutely nothing to do with a story at all but are just there to push their narrative and political views.

It was odd however that Vivien is rude most of the time to that loving husband of hers - and how unbelievable it is for him to just go on putting up with Vivien's complete lack of concern or care for the pregnancy or her family life.The show was interesting but not much believable, especially towards the end - when people including Vivien and her colleagues start rooting for this un-feeling con artist and a sociopath with absolutely ZERO conscience - did that really happen or was it one of the 'made up' parts ? Can people be really so stupid ? I doubt that. The last episode was quite blaaah for lack of better words.Each episode was based on one character (read victim) at a time. So that was interesting.The actress Julia Garner that played Anna - seemed expressionless most of the time...may be thats how its supposed to be? Is it ?

I agree with the CNN article about the weird odd fake accent that was one of the big negatives of the show.Loved all the other actors on the show especially Katy Lowes who played Rachel - she was amazing and it shows what a ridiculously talented actress she is. It was odd that Rachel is crucified just because she decided to monetize what Anna did to her. Loved the warm sweet support group that Vivien has at work - all my fav actors !I know that Shonda has the tendency to add some unnecessarily 'extreme' stuff on her shows - so a few things are a real put off and disgusting plus they just don't blend into the story line and seemed forced.Pros : The great cast, Katy Lowes, Anna Chlumsky, direction and locales !Cons : Fake accent , Fake accent and did I say Fake accent - its just torture!

I see many people complain about the pacing, but I think it held intrigue for just long enough. The story is incredibly interesting, and that all should have made for a terrific program, with the exception of one enormous flaw.The last episode:
With any crime-to-courtroom drama, the last episode will always be the most interesting and also the easiest to write. Especially that since the beginning of the series Anna is shown conducting interviews from inside jail. The final episode of Inventing Anna seems to side-step this entirely. The character motivations of practically everyone around Anna are entirely flipped on episode 9, to the point where it starts corroding the rest of the show. The characters that have been firmly established and fleshed out are now taking on entirely new personalities, it's like everyone grabbed the wrong script during the last shoot. Vivian, the main protagonist that sacrificed and struggled to expose Anna is seen rooting for her in the last episode, along with her coworkers that also helped with her expose. On the other hand, Anna, who is narcissistic, self-involved, psychotic and vile comes off as the most likable and, oddly, most predictable character in this entire episode, for the simple fact that she stays true to her character.I had to pause halfway through and check the episode page to make sure I had not skipped an entire episode, let alone an entire season to justify the complete lack of character congruency.What results is a confusing and dissatisfying end to what could have been an otherwise brilliant piece of television.",1,1,/user/ur150259217/?ref_=tt_urv

I gave up when the characters starting acting out of character-- not just for their corner of society, but for themselves as written in earlier episodes.

What a disappointment. Whatever accent she was going for, she found one that made her at times quite difficult to understand.Anna Chlumsky is another fine actor...wasted. Her character is just too smart to not notice that she continually gets pulled in by Anna, and for some reason there were so many close up shots of Chlumsky's face throughout this series that they began to get uncomfortable to view.The trio of Jeff Perry, Terry Kinney, and Anna Deavere Smith (a fine group of actors) come across as a combination of The Three Stooges and three doddering simpleminded Baby Boomers.Laverne Cox was so one note, her performance was hard to watch/listen.As for the storyline, Anna was a con artist who got caught.She was very good at reading other people and getting them to do what she wanted to get done. The only person close to Anna, the only person Anna cared about, was Anna.For me the two most telling scenes in the series were when Chlumsky's character talked to Anna's parents in their house in Germany and when Anna, from prison, had the late night conversation with her lawyer's very young son.We learn from her parents that there never really was a connection between them as parents and Anna as their child. From the conversation Anna had with the young boy, we get to see someone (Anna) who gives a very simplistic explanation to the boy that the best thing you can do is learn to manipulate people to get what you want.At the end of the series we see how many of the characters benefited from their having at one time been connected to Anna. The final shot of Anna on the prison bus I assume is supposed to make the audience feel sorry for her because she did all the work and everyone else benefited.

I have not yet watched the British version and I find it hard to believe that they did so much better with this style of writing. My guess is that the American version is using guest stars that Americans actually know who they are and want to see attempt to improv. I took a brief look at the English version and I don't recognize any of their guest stars so it really takes the point away from the show. I'm sure it's more funny to those who are familiar with these guest stars on the English version but that doesn't necessarily make it better.Also it's kind of fun trying to guess the murder.Normally I would deduct five points because of Hollywood's woke agenda item making its way into the show, however because it made me laugh many times I'm willing to overlook this one.

The celebrity doesn't have a script and thus the whole show is improvised with a few key expositional points. At the end, the semi-celebrity has to figure out the murder.The problem is, the main character is such an arch-type of male comedy at this point (mostly made famous by Will Ferrell 20 years ago) that there's not much new that can be done with it. So it's very generic. Will Arnett is funny, but in this role he just seems exhausted and wandering through the motions.The other big issue is improv like this, can get chuckles at the local comedy club because it's a live experience, but in a produced video setting, it just seems lazy. The semi-celebrity guest seems to be the only one having fun, and several of them feel as though the show is chore. If they don't care that much, why should the viewer?I guess if you play along and try to figure out the murder yourself, you make a game out of it, which could be fun. But if you're looking for actual comedy gold, it's not here. There's rarely anything to smirk at.Marshawn Lynch is atrocious. He never once takes it seriously. Kumail acts like he's bigger than TV, and is above doing comedy anymore (sad, because he can be hilarious.) Annie Murphy is breaking the whole time even when things aren't funny....it's like she's trying to trick us into thinking it's funny. Conan and Sharon Stone are probably the best. They are true professionals, so it shouldn't be surprising. Stone may not be funny at all, but she's a talented actor and it makes it work.

Will Arnett is constantly hiding his face, because he can't keep his cool.The guests are all pretty good, but Marshawn Lynch, who I did not know about before this, because American Football is not really a thing in Finland, just commits so much to the part that the whole thing should open new doors to him.

My only complaint is that the guest stars in the US version, who have to improvise without a script, all come from comedy or acting backgrounds, so they improvise well and there's very little corpsing.

I laughed sincerely a grand total of 2 times, and that's where my generous 2-star review is coming from.The tone, plot, and seemingly the budget, are what I would expect out of a bad 80's cop comedy that should have never made it out of the pilot process.Nothing really works. Arnett's character is a goofy, but grizzled, clown-like collection of cop clichés. In these kinds of stories it usually helps to have a ""straight person"", who's there to highlight the idiocy of the idiot, but everyone's an idiot. It's strange to say that in a show that is essentially a farce from beginning to end, that the plots make no sense, but it shows just how poor the writing is when the plot of a farce is distractingly nonsensical.It seems like one of the main conceits of the show is that it is highly improvised, and they lean into this by purposefully showing the actors breaking up, but they don't go far enough in this direction to make that aspect the funnier part of the show and the improvisation itself is again, just not funny.Just bafflingly bad all around. Such a shame given the caliber of the talent in front of the camera.Maybe it'll be your thing if you're into silly, cop shows from the 80's, but Sledge Hammer this is not.

The show has a story and multiple murders that spread out between the guests. And from the 6 episodes, I enjoyed all of them. Will Arnett makes this role his own and makes it tough on the guests joining in by trying to make them do things out of their comfort zone. And if you paid attention, some props or things mentioned in the episode were tied to the guest. I won't spoil anything but I wanted more and don't know if there will be.

Reminiscent of Rock Hudson in ""Giant"", he is trying to hold on to the old ways.""Yellowstone"" develops quickly with little introduction, yet its story unravels with the natural pace of a wilderness day, pausing for tribal rituals, cowboy conventionalities, and political machinations. It's a far flung undertaking that dwells on the seams between laws and justice, family and friendships.Costner fills his character's boots naturally, it seems. He is a world-wearied man who has seen too much and lied too often. The land and the family are his lifeblood. He can hear the footsteps coming his way, but he can only fulfill his role-out of habit as much as loyalty.Although some action is a little confusing due to lack of explanation, it feels natural, as if the viewer is getting a genuine slice-of-life glimpse into another world.

Of course, it does want to be more in spite of it's gratuitous use of foul language and sex. It wants to be timely too. The division between Wall Street, Native Americans, and a rich land baron who happens to be a rancher is all being played here. The only commonality among the disparate parties is greed. If Costner is trying to be the righteous defender then he's doing it primarily for his own designs as he's painted in the initial episode. That gives him that special JR Ewing sauce. So is it a soap or a statement against squandering natural resources? I see a well-financed new stab at a family soap here. The cinematography is rich using what appears to be Wyoming as a decent stand in for Montana. Certainly there age some good things. I hope the show becomes more real + actually giving insight in how the ruining of what is left of pristine wilderness is playing out That's not as likely as a whole raft of dark back-stabbing will likely be the plan.

Neither are believable nor do they fit their character's roles. The actress playing Beth really sinks her teeth into the role and plays it with gusto. Kevin Costner owns the Patriarch role.A few of the negatives (more like distractions) are the annoying way Kevin Costner constantly pushes his tongue against the inside of his lower lip, the lack of transitions between scenes, and the fact that the way in which medical conditions featured on the show are written, are just neither accurate nor rooted in any reality!

The series is essentially a crime story set in a modern western setting and it mostly works great.The show has its flaws, as well as some forced characters, but it compensates with an interesting plot and a tense story, as well as excellently shot action scenes.We see the usual flaws of today's film production, as well as some forced situations and dialogues, but it's surprisingly well balanced, every argument has a counter-argument and the writers really try to entertain the viewer.The cast is mostly excellent, and the actors are really good at their roles. The environment is interesting, the cinematography is excellent and the series has a cinematic look.Yes, some characters may be forced, for example Beth, who is arguably the weakest link in the series, but even that character has a purpose, no matter how irritating. The characters are complicated, layered and most importantly, interesting and fun. The supporting characters are great and they are an important link in the whole story.Kevin Costner is great in the role of John Dutton, one of his best roles, perfect casting. But other actors are equally great, for example Cole Hauser in the role of Rip Wheeler.All these good things outweigh the minor flaws in the series and make it worth watching.

A ranch of this importance in Montana would be about half this size (close to 300,000 acres) with only a couple of hundred residents ... so yeah I'm talking unlimited space.They mean it when they call it ""Big Sky Country""So how did one man (and others of his ilk) get to own so much land in less than 150 years?Well of course, they stole it from the Indians and the Indians want it back.I would be mad too, if I was an Indian living in poverty while the white man makes billions off of my great grandfather's happy hunting grounds.Not only that, but other well heeled Americans want to escape the fetid swamps of the crime ridden cities and live an urban cowboy life of luxury in their own log cabin, with a swimming pool and a country club to round things out. The only way for developers to carve out a piece of the
desirable wilderness and chop it up to lot sizes, is to bully their way through.And that my friends is the backdrop/plot for this superbly acted series.Costner is unassailable in his role as the Rancher John Dutton, a no- nonsense patriarch chiseled out of Montana Rock.

Others actors also do a good job.The problem is with the writing. Its childish and onedimensional, and incredibly forced, constantly artificially making infantile conflicts.Like Kayce's wife. Kayce, a great dad who would do anything for her and kid but first she leaves him for absurd reasons (out of his control). On top of that, she constantly torments him and is running him through hoops. Not to mention, she sulks throughout THE WHOLE show. Nothing but complain, is moody and a total Btch...The same Beth. Nothing but childing sarcasm,insults and being a brat. The most illogical thing her (and EVERYBODY else) tormenting and being hard on Jaime. Who is ironically the most loyal and dedicated of the whole family. He literally went to law school because his dad asked him and protects the family 24/7. While Kayce doesnt want anything to do with the ranch and Beth only comes home if she feels like it. And they insult him all the time. He then makes ONE mistake,which is 100% understandable after a lifetime of bullying and telling him hes worthless, despite he dedicated his whole life to his family, and they want to kill him. Beth the brat especially, who did nothing but run away from home and comes back every few years...Makes ZERO sense. Who TF writes this nonsense. And in general, every character has issues and conflicts with everybody. Nobody talks to anyone and resolves matter. All they do is scheme and fight.
Or stupid things that the writers forget or think the viewers are too stupid to notice. Like when John says goodbye, writers the letter and even says to his family ""this is gonna be the end of us"" and how hes not coming back.
What happens?
Nothing. They just put that in for drama, the cheapest possible plot point.
Or how they ride in into a compound defended by PROFESSIONAL militia and ex soldiers with vests,nightvision/thermal vision etc... And Rip just rides in on his horse and with a shotgun in the middle of it with John on his side and NOBODY hits them, despite being in the open with light in their eyes and the enemy being professionals with obstacles to protect them. And nevermind that Rip and John and everybody else hit every single enemy target.

It simply is and that's a fact! This series is second to none and that's a promise!This show is an experience. An emotional one filled with constant conflict filled with REAL cowboys. There's something so romanticizing about western shows captured and executed perfectly. When's the last time a series in this genre even mentioned the word ""Wranglers"". Its very authentic. Too real. And the dialogue is incredible. There are countless quotes from this show. That's where this show sets a precedent. THE WRITING! It is stellar and flawless.Every episode improves upon the former. It builds and builds. There are so many characters that you will become invested in and 3D characters. Every actor involved in this show has a very intriguing story or background. You'll be convinced after you realize how fast you binge the two seasons and beginning of the third (s3 episode one available at the time of this review)This also presents factual history of native Americans and casts the possibility of people learning what really happened and how important it is in order to appreciate every Native American. But this show DOES NOT force any agenda down your throat. western series always go hand in hand with Indians. Its always been cowboys and Indians but this show has presented the cowboy life, ranchers lives, and native Americans like never before.

Yellowstone's character John Dutton I believe is the most perfectly matched role Kevin Costner has ever played. I almost feel like if he could have chose a life as a second alternative to being a movie star he would of chosen to be John Dutton. Even with all the pain that he's endured through life. Yellowstone for me conjures that excitement of peering into a world I'm not apart of like watching the classic night time soaps like ""Dallas"" & ""Dynasty"" the only difference is ""Yellowstone"" is the night time soap for tough guys that women will enjoy just as much. The characters are phenomenal with so many different angles at play. The power shifting between the native reservation, the ranch, the law and the political pundits creates a vast storyline that's very entertaining to watch play out. Of course with a big production like this it's not surprising the acting, music, videography and beautiful landscapes leaves you in awe everytime you watch but nothing's ever guaranteed just because a big pile of money is behind something doesn't mean it will succeed but viewers have shown praise and appreciation for a show that provides a pretty big bang for every single buck.

The Duttons want to preserve their ranch that has been in their family for seven generations. That is understandable and as a viewer I root for them. I wonder how the heck that they are able to pay for the land and inheritance taxes. In the first season the main antagonists is the Tribal chief of the Indian reservation who allies himself with Dan Jenkins who is a silver tongued business man. I really couldn't hate them because the chief wants to protect the reservation and Dan Jenkins wants to build his casino and hotel. After a few more episodes it seems like the writers wanted to change everything and introduced new villains in the form of the Beck brothers who were simple clichés of evil. Then there's the ""magic cure"" for everything from a common cold to cancer which is a bullet to the head. The first scene we see is John Dutton shooting a wounded horse in the head and we see it again when a man is burned badly in an explosion. And then there are the injuries and illnesses that are incurable but not in Montana when all you need to is ""man up"" and ignore the illness and it will go away because a cowboy can't get sick.

Crimes that are never acknowledged nor is there any consequences for.
Way too much time spent showing that Taylor Sheridan can ride a horse in real life.
One minute Monica is telling PT dude that she's married, then she's making out with him, then she's packed and willing to move to the ranch. (A place she hates)
It makes absolutely no sense why the Beck brothers would care about the casino which again leads to crimes not being acknowledged.
What happened to the dead reporters story that was so damning for John ? The autopsy would've showed she was strangled.
Jamie is just fine giving up being a lawyer so he can be a wrangler ?
Since when do you get criminal backgrounds of parents of adopted children when you ask for a birth certificate ?
Beth has hated Jamie since she was 15 and nobody bothered to ask why in twenty years ?
Jamie goes from ranch hand, to Livestock Commissioner, to Attorney General in a week ?
Kayce's past is shady AF yet he's being courted for Governor.
Jamie has one conversation with his bio dad (who murdered his bio mom) and he's ready to destroy his adopted family ?

The way he totally controls everything on the res is not believable. The Kayce character and the things he does wouldn't be tolerated anywhere, and the John Dutton character is like a comic book character, branding some of his employees and even his son as though they were livestock. That's the kind of caricature you don't really need to tell a story.There are characters that are likable and some that are easy to despise. This is the kind of story that is absorbing, so it's easy to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the tale.The second season requires a little more heavy lifting for the job of suspension of disbelief in the despicable character side of things, with the descent of Jamie into madness and Beth's sociopathology coming out more.The scene in the boutique is so totally unbelievable that the heavy lifting becomes an impossible task. Taylor Sheridan's character is worse in the second season. Where he was just a kind of snide, self satisfied horse dealer in season 1, he becomes a total prick in season 2 with his boasting dismissal of the hapless jimmy, who is desperate to win a bet so he can get the meth cookers off his grandfather's case. I hope Sheridan is deliberately making his character unlikable. If he's playing himself, I can only conclude that he's not at all likable.There's still a lot to like about Yellowstone in season 2.

tt4236770,ur34064689,10,12 February 2022,"I've arrived late to the party on very few shows over the years. I was one of the first to watch Breaking bad, an early watcher of shows like Game of thrones, The Wire and Sons of Anarchy, but with Yellowstone the show simply wasn't on my radar until the hype surrounding it began to reach far and wide.I initially heard about Yellowstone at the same time as it's prequel '1883' had been released, and at the time of writing this review I'm currently 7 episodes into that show. Watching 1883 and getting everything I want from a show about the Wild West days I was hesitant to begin watching Yellowstone, as I feared I wouldn't enjoy it's modern ways of office politics instead of good ol cowboying, but boy was I wrong.Yellowstone still has all the inner circle battles and Wild West violence, but it give us a look at how a modern family has to navigate the world with more caution and smarts, rather than always shooting to kill with your trusty revolver. It mixes the politics of it all perfectly with the violence but more importantly the threat of violence, one thing many shows forget about entirely. It's not all about the bangs and explosions, it also has to come with a story and characters and that's what Yellowstone does so well.It's characters feel like a real family, not actors reading lines and getting a pay cheque at the end of it. They have struggles and dilemmas to overcome and witnessing how they try to solve those issues in ways real people would is what can be utterly captivating.The lineup of actors in Yellowstone is superb and being led by the great Kevin Costner is something that keeps you thoroughly entertained and engrossed as you witness them doing what they do best.From playing deputy chief David Hale in Sons of anarchy to writing two of the best shows currently on TV, Taylor Sheridan shows us what great television really is with Yellowstone, a mix of amazing actors, well written characters, a deep and meaningful story that lasts from season to season, and more importantly a show that knows when to ramp up the pace and keep us guessing at what's going to happen next.One thing that very few people will mention is Yellowstones episode structure. Each episode picks up directly after the last, meaning you never get that feeling of missing out on large periods of time, the next episode resumes right where you left of. This is something I absolutely love to see and only very few shows do. It makes everything feel that little bit more real as you see the days pass by almost in real time with a sense of scale to how and when things happen. I can't explain why I enjoy this so much but I think it just creates a much better sense of immersion in a TV show.In terms of the overall episode by episode basis I find myself giving almost every episode a 10/10 with only a few dropping down to 9/10. I haven't seen an episode yet where I felt it was bad in any way. There has been slower episodes for sure, most notably the first episode in season 3 where far less happens, it simply introduces us back to the Dutton family and how they're coping with the fallout from the events of season 2, but once again the episode was structured beautifully and was still a joy to watch.The characters themselves are a huge part of what keeps you around and I have to say characters like Beth are what a show needs. Some will hate her, some will love her, some won't understand her and what motivates her. That's what it's all about. Not just some bimbo there to make up the numbers or someone who's painted in good or bad colours. Someone who like almost all of us lives in the grey, a good person more than capable of doing very bad things. Was Walter white a bad man from the start ? No. Evolution and witnessing it unfold is a joy to watch and this happens to almost every character in Yellowstone. For me Rip is my favourite character of the show, a man who tries to live day by day doing what he can to help the people around him, a tough but fair kind of man, but a man who if you cross him, you better sleep with a gun on your pillow. I look at him as almost a Cowboy John Wick and that's what I want, a tough as nails badass guy but with a deep evolving story to tell.One thing no one can deny about Yellowstone is it's beautiful scenery, I mean some of these shots are actually picturesque. The stunning mountains and large open land make for one hell of a setting and for me its the cherry on the cake with Yellowstone, not only a fantastic show but a gorgeous one too.From writing this review I'm currently 4 episodes into season 3 and as I previously mentioned I find myself utterly addicted to finding out what will happen next. The key to a good show is that you just want to binge watch it all day long, and Yellowstone has me doing that as I've watched all those episodes in just 3 days.Overall I have to say this is a show that some people with simpler tastes may turn away from, but from someone who's seen almost every great show there has been, this is right up there scrapping it out with the best of them. I simply cannot find a fault with Yellowstone as it has everything I want from a TV show and hopefully if you give it a chance too, you will find it as addictive and brilliant as I do. 10/10.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur34064689/?ref_=tt_urv

tt4236770,ur24756236,5,4 September 2020,"Been locked into this since it arrived and the reviews of the first few seasons are fairly accurate across the board.My problem comes from the writing of Sheridan---he is his own worst enemy at times. The ""veterinarian syndrome"" , that is a reference to the cancer diagnosis/misdiagnosis] that further drags down the script, that suffers from heavy-handed social injustices to the Native Americans as it is. Not downplaying these very relevant injustices...but if you have seen any of his recent films, its something that he seems to clumsily include. And not a little.This last season, could feel a bit of the shark leaping...okay, maybe its a true jump. Yellowstone Whiskey ads just had me eyerolling my way through this not so good season of stumbles, culminating in a sequence in the third act of the finale that---lets just say---was the epitome of how not to trope your way into a season ender, complete with a scene where a mother was dug up to get the wedding band? A green mother no less...yes, you read that right. The cliffhanging at that outro is again, just-so-tropey and silly it has me longing for this season to have just never happened.This season took the clear-cut 9 rating and knocked it down enough (7) where I just no longer care about the characters or the silly, mindnumbingly terrible, on the fly script fixes that Sheridan puts on full display once again. Ultimately his fatal flaws as a screen writer, Hell or High Water notwithstanding, as that film is near flawless---unraveled and ruined what was a stumble of a season before the third act of the finale.",4,9,/user/ur24756236/?ref_=tt_urv

But, the audience is what matters and my reviews is only one viewpoint based on what the film displays on an emotional level whether it be ficitional or not. Most good portrayals of fiction are partly based on history anyway.This is a good one and just seen by me today from a friend that recommended it and I can see why now. She emphasized the blunt nature of several of the scenes while I remembered the actress from ""Flight"" with Denzel Washington.She is good to see in another character portrayal as well as Kevin Costner with the good memories of his epic performance where he wanted to see the frontier before it was gone. That ties in the Indians who were robbed of land together in history with the Spanish/Mexicans who were also robbed within the Louisiana Purchase days of old.Well worth the admirable effort made together with a respect for the state of Utah and how important real property remains to everyone who has been an owner before. *MontanaThank you kindly for the opportunity to review and place these episodes in lists according to personal interests that might be shared with other world inhabitants.All men with honor are kings, what no man can give you, and none can take away.

I'm pretty sure that's the moral of this story - that the means justifies the ends, we're not as bad as them, so when we murder our adversaries we are protecting ourselves and have just cause... fire at will. As for Jaimie, good grief what a parasite. I don't know what the diagnosis would be but it is very distasteful.

I don't get the focus on Jimmy... couldn't they give us just one regular character who isn't damaged, and a credible romance with his girl? Look, I've watched every episode up too the middle of season 4, it's not great but I've not found much else of interest and Costner is good and I'm enjoying the scenery and the horses... and Rip is amusing in his unhesitant directness.

A lot of plot lines just peeter out (the stripper ranch hand, the dinasour bones). The most frustrating part of the show is Jamie's lack of growth or momentum as a character. Vulture described the show as ""banal mythopoetic navel-gazin"" and I agree. The ranching metaphors are very shallow, no biting commentary on classism here, and the plot's impacts are never permanent. I think season 2 and season 3 really just rehash the same stuff.

I do wish the writer had done a better job consulting cowboys though. And although I like the actors in the series, it would've helped if a few of them had more riding lessons before tackling these roles. Cole Hauser is a good actor and superb in this role of ""Rip"". But watching him ride is sad. Also, the dialogue needed more research. Avery says ""I can break colts"". Nobody who trains or breaks horses say ""colts"". Colts are young males (stallions). Does Avery only break stud horses? No young mares (filly's)? Plus, most males are cut by 2yr olds when trained. So they're actually geldings, not stud colts. The good thing?

I do get old vibes of Dallas, but with a far stronger, grittier realism. This is one of the few series whose ratings go up with each successive season, and a testimony of its success is multiple spin-off shows. Credit to Tyler Sheridan.I have always been a fan of Kevin Costner, and I can say without a shred of doubt this is his magnum opus. He commands every scene, with quiet strength, dignity and wisdom, honouring his forbears who kept the Dutton ranch going for a century and a half. By no means was this done without dark deeds, if anything the aspect that makes this series so compelling is the moral and ethical ambiguity of each character, on every side of the fence. This series is chock full of nuggets of wisdom and quotable lines, and one is very apt - ""The angels have all gone, there are only devils left.""
Secondly, the character of Beth played masterfully by Kelly Reilly is truly a wonder to behold, tragic and despicable at the same time, noble and contemptuous at once. To be forged in a moment of great disaster, and to be haunted by that for one's entire life, is a remarkably sad arc. Nevertheless, Beth shows the epitome of loyalty, courage and imagination, and in her own chaotic way is the antiheroic heart of this slowly dying family. I do not pity her, as it seems clear she is the ultimate survivor and saviour.We certainly see the rugged individualism and stoicism of the pioneer wild west, and perhaps the yearning to return to such macho bravado is driving the series popularity. It seems we live in untethered times with no grounded rules, creeds or codes. Folks yearn for a simpler era. There is a ruthlessness to life in this valley, nevertheless, there is mutual justice and support woven into life, where everyone truly knows everyone and is quick to reward or punish.Life on modern native American or Canadian First Nation reservations is almost never shown, especially in a positive or realistic light. I tremendously appreciate this show for demonstrating an unvarnished, unfiltered look into the harsh brutality of life on the res, as they say. The struggles to survive, to stay alive and out of prison, are all too real. The interesting aspect of Casino owning confederations buying back ancestral lands is quite well shown here, and I have seen parallels in the news. The legacy of the oppressed continues sadly, sown in seeds of past injustice.The stunning vistas of every scene are just majestic. Every single shot makes me yearn to learn to ride a horse and head on out at sunrise. Unspoiled beauty, the glory of Creation, such is the backdrop of Yellowstone.As Taylor Sheridan begins to build an empire, and as super positive reviews of 1883 roll in, it is clear he knows what he is doing in the multiple shows in the Sheridan-verse.

Yellowstone. That show is insane. He takes elements from Wind River, especially regarding native Americans, but goes way too far with the ""cowboy mafia""... They ""brand"" each other, they kill anybody they want,the Dutton sons and daughter are all crazy in their own way, it's just too much. It's way too unrealistic. I've been to this part of the world, it's not like that at all... Sure there's some money being tossed around, but not that much... Here they make it like it's the new Wall Street... If you wanna talk money, Colorado, Utah and Alaska all are richer than Wyoming. And Wyoming is one of the safest states in the country, there's like 15 murders a year over there, which is less than the number of murders we see in 10 episodes of Yellowstone, so come on... It's also very frustrating to see that almost everyone is corrupt, or corruptible, that you can blow up a mountain like that, or botch a criminal investigation just by asking a priest to influence someone during a sermon... It's just not believable.There's also a lot a gratuitous violence and nudity, really not needed at all, and a severe lack of plot. You can watch this thing on fast forward, you wouldn't be lost. It's just a lot of yelling, a lot of quiet threats, and maybe here and there an ok side plot... I kept watching it for Kayce, Rainwater and Jimmy, but all the main characters are annoying.

I had never even heard or read about ""Yellowstone"" and I was wondering what network it was on to go watch it but I come to find it out that Paramount made this but aired it on their own network, which was something I never heard of ""Paramount Network"" either?. I ended up watching it on Amazon Prime and I was really impressed from the writing, actor/casting, production and superb direction. I think the reason this show is unknown is because Paramount didn't distribute or shop it around other major cable networks like ""HBO"" , Showtime"" or ""Cinnemax"", this show actually is more suited for Cinnemax; it would had a wider audience and following.I like this writer/director's work from ""Wind River""; here once again in this show ""YS"" some of the same themes about the Native Americans is explored, but on much larger scale. Many people compare this show to ""Sopranos""?!..I found that to be wrong. John Dutton is not Mafia boss, but wealthy powerful cowboy who does not want his environment change, he likes to live the same way his ancestors had lived from the time US took ownership of the land from the Native Americans. He does not believe real estate investments or apartments bldgs, ski resort and Casinos is progress but the exact opposite; and as much as we may not agree with Dutton's ways of enforcing his ideology. However, the more you learn about Dutton and his past, about the other characters like ""RIP"" , and the way of life in Montana, the more you take in the views of the amazing country in every episodes, the more you seem to align with Dutton's position. Dutton is a man of principles and no where near as ruthless as Tony Soprano who killed his own nephew (Chris) just to get a rid of possible problem.Dutton's character struggles between conflicts of not just the land but his own children, the worse being his sociopath daughter ""Beth"", who is consumed by selfloathing and angry, whom Dutton can unleash on the monsters who want change his way old way of life. His relationship with his other son's like Kacye and Jaime is also based on control but when he knows the Kacye is more independent and yet he sees a lot of himself in Kayce than all his children. One of the most interesting characters in the show was ""RIP"". Rip can be seen as a brutal heartless killer; yet at the same the more we found out about his past and the loss his shares with Beth is what makes you understand him better. Dutton also seeks to brand these damaged characters like ""Jimmy"", to own their loyalty. When we seem Jimmy get branded by RIP, it's almost as cruel as enforced slavery, yet Jimmy; who seems like a slacker/loser/ meth head finds purpose through his struggles being a cowboy. That is what Dutton gives these damaged people whose only other options is future of crime or death.This was very hard show to watch at times, not because of violence but mostly through the cruelty of characters like ""Beth"", whom I could not find any kind of empathy or likeness after watching two seasons. This character's hate for her brother Jaime is so cruel and extreme that yet her reasons are not explained clearly in the show?. I think today there are so many TV Drama cable shows with female characters; like ""Beth"", that portray this cruel/vicious hateful person and I don't know if these Female characters send a message out to our society that this how you have to be to be powerful?. it's really sick to watch these kind of characters and there is so much of it out there and people then why we have such a struggle in people's staying married or together.Overall this is a interesting show; ,more like ""Ray Donovan"" tban Sopranos, I never thought Sopranos had much depth but this ""Yellowstone"" has a lot more depth to come away from with, they just need to change their network from Paramount to reach wider audience.",10,17,/user/ur1256195/?ref_=tt_urv

Throughout season one in its entirety nearly nothing happens that isn't contrived - and that's just how the show feels. One silly episode synopsis read something about John Dutton's secret, which is brought up as a concern, regarding elections, by a governor to a AG candidate (which is not John Dutton) - it's utterly absurd. And that's this show. Absurd. Driving with your son, have a gun in the glove, and see a strange van on the side of the road?

This show is not that, at all. If you want a reference in terms of the feel of the show, think ""Banshee"" with a much bigger budget... if you want a reference in terms of production quality, we are right up there with the best shows on TV.Also, this show does not have any political connotations, calling it ""woke"" or ""anti-woke"" like some do - is absurd - it's neither, it's just a good show, irrespective of your political beliefs (which should not factor into what a ""good show"" is anyway).That rant over - back to the Godfather analogy:Set in rural modern day Montana, the show is centered around a horse and cattle ranch owner and patriarch, played by Kevin Costner... the ""Vito Corleone"" of the show, if you will... and yes, Costner is still a stellar actor, especially in a rural setting.Luke Grimes playing the youngest son, is the Michael Corleone of the show, just as split between two worlds, and just as ruthless when he needs to be.... and he plays the role with such conviction, that you completely forget he is an actor.Cole Hauser plays the adopted son of the house, an amalgamation of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen, and plays the role with such ferocity, that he is just about the coolest, hardest modern day cowboy - ever - on TV.Wes Bentley plays our version of Fredo Corleone, constantly balancing on a knifes edge, being split between loyalty to the family and his own ambition.Kelsey Asbille plays a breakthrough role, as the native American version of Kay Adams, constantly split between her love for the youngest son of the house, and her hatred of the family, that historically cheated hers out of land.Last, but most definitely not least, Kelly Reilly is our version of Connie Corleone... but smarter, tougher and much more ambitious... I view her role in this as a career maker... she is just fantastic in this show.It all takes place in beautiful big sky country, lots of horses, lots of cowboy work, lot's of gun fights and explosions, that are all choreographed with such quality, that every action sequence in the show seems real, while never feeling out of place.I cannot think of a single thing, that brings this show down, and now in the middle of season 3, it is still the show I look forward to the most.So I highly recommend the show, but you need to watch the first full season to get into it, like most really good shows, it starts off at a slow burn, to set up the characters and the plot... but don't worry, you WILL be entertained.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur24232661/?ref_=tt_urv

tt4236770,ur78318989,7,17 July 2019,"Not what I was expecting. I was thinking this was going to be a show about folks working their family ranch and the day to day trials involved in that. It's not about that at all.......it's about a destructive family destroying everyone they come into contact with. This show is dark, really dark......to the point where none of the main characters are likeable. It's all about the Yellowstone no matter how many people have to die to protect it.None of the main characters have any redeeming qualities. You'll find yourself hating all of them at some point. Even the young grandson has anger issues. The only characters with any character at all are a couple of the ranch hands. The daughter is awful (really awful), the older son gets beat down like a child and can't stand up for himself. You want to like the younger son but every time you think he's turning a corner you realize he's as messed up as the rest of them. Kevin Costner's character might be the darkest of all of them.....how could any man treat his family the way he does? He seems to love the land more than he loves them. The family's enemies are just as unlikeable. But, to be honest, at some point it's hard to decide who to root for because they are all equally despicable.In typical hollywood fashion there's some silliness. Some of the fight scenes are exaggerated. People would die if you beat them like that. And of course, there's the obligatory lesbian couple even though it adds nothing to the storyline. They work in some liberal causes as well, especially when it comes to the American Indian. They act as if Indian tribes weren't fighting and killing each other long before the white man arrived.

tt4236770,ur1097934,9,27 December 2021,"I grew up in South Dakota and like western movies and shows as long as there's enough realism and fun. A western must show some understanding of rural life while avoiding the inevitable boredom that any rural native knows goes with it. I avoided watching Yellowstone until late 2021 because there were several things that just didn't look authentic to me.First, Kevin Costner doesn't look like or make me think ""Rancher"" in the series. You can argue that point all you want, and I love Dances with Wolves, but I grew up with farmers and ranchers, and he's not it.Second, I saw a lot of Native American (or indigenous, if you want) and cowboys' clothing that looked laughably, ridiculously unrealistic. I'm talking about cowboy clothing that made me think of Back to the Future's 50's cowboy clothes and probably the worst looking plastic'y Native American clothing you'd ever see at a tourist trap on rural interstates.Both these things made me cringe as someone who's grown up with the real deal, so I avoided this series as Hollywood-fake.For whatever reason, Yellowstone has become very popular recently, so I was constantly seeing it. Being a big fan of Longmire and having watched all the episodes multiple times, I finally gave Yellowstone a chance and watched the first couple of episodes. I was pleasantly surprised that it grew on me and I realized I was mostly wrong about what I previously thought about it.I'm finishing up the current season, taking my time, I've watched 1883 (what's available), and I'm interested in the 6666 series I've heard about, since I grew up watching rodeos, often near where I lived.Kevin Costner really is not believable as the head of a rich ranch or farm family. But I'm a big fan of Costner and many movies he's done (The Postman, Water World, to name a few) that have been panned by critics, and he's good enough to suspend my disbelief.Most scenes of the Dutton family home/area are ridiculously over-exaggerated in how nice they look. Anybody who has known real millionaire farm and ranch families and their homes, as I have, knows they look mostly like their less successful neighbors. Sometimes you'll see the money in the cars they sometimes drive or the clothes they sometimes wear, but on a daily basis they look like any other farmer or rancher.The parts of the story dealing with ""liberal hippies"" crowding into local towns and trying to force change are extremely exaggerated. I may be clueless about the current wave of liberal hippie immigration to the northern plains states, but I've literally driven to and from all of these states many, many times over the past 30 years, up until the pandemic anyway, and I've never seen anything close to what you see in this show.Some parts showing Native American costumes could be believed in the context of a showy-show in front of an Indian casino, but it's still a little weird. Conflicts with people on the reservations, as in Longmire, are often very much exaggerated, but not too ridiculous.Despite all these problems, it's the story and the writing that shows through to carry this series. And boy, it could be so much worse, but I'd still watch it for the story and the writing.And realistically, I think the Yellowstone ""universe"" is more about Texas than it is about Montana, which partially explains these problems. It would be more believable if it were set in Texas since I hear people living in Texas complaining about some of this stuff, and I believe at least one writer is from Texas, which also explains the 6666 storyline, which has no equivalent in the northern plains states.Either way, Yellowstone is very enjoyable TV show when you overlook the problems, and worthy of a 9/10 rating for a TV show.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur1097934/?ref_=tt_urv

tt4236770,ur82316881,6,30 January 2021,"Yellowstone, as a dramatic production, is driven by several key character cliques - wealthy Caucasian mid-western American range owners or similar, marginalised indigenous American peoples, and the stunningly beautiful Montana wilderness. There is one further clique, stereotypically situated as innate to the operation of a modern-day live-stock ranch - horse riding cowboys.Politically, storyline narrative is suggestively sympathetic to the plight of indigenous tribal peoples relegated to the sovereign confines of federal reservation life. However, realistically, the cultural legacies of unreconciled American history do not appear to be dealt with sincerely by the series writers. Operatively, while the socio-economic iniquities of indigenous tribal life are alluded to across the serialised storyline, practical solutions are framed in terms of Caucasian, neo-liberal capitalist language, vocabulary and ambitions. In short, there remains an inherent cultural disconnect between what is creatively portrayed as beneficial and supportive of indigenous societal empowerment and what indigenous peoples themselves likely hold to be salient and culturally relevant.For example, indigenous North American tribal groups were genocidally subjected to the acculturating impacts of the denial of access to, and connection with, their native lands. Operatively, their language, spirituality, political, social, kinship and tribal frameworks underpinning their culture were either outlawed or destroyed outright, or disestablished. Consequently, for most indigenous peoples, globally, and specifically in North America, their cultural identity remains eviscerated. What constituted cultural identity within indigenous horse-based cultures in this context, anchored within hunter-gather existential existence, was brutally extinguished and socially destabilised.Yellowstone does not realistically engage with this historical artifact. Rather, it appears to rationalise and legitimize the perspective, power, control and privilege of large-scale castle ranchers as semi-heroic figures of American cultural significance in a positive sense. This is unscored in the romantic depiction of daily cowboy life on the Dutton farm. There is an inherent danger this production will merely succeed in sanitising the acceptability, normalization and legitimisation of American historical indigenous cultural denial.Arguably, endemic American racial disharmony aside, Yellowstone does not attempt to address the horrendously unreconciled anchor of modern-day cultural construal concerning how America evolved from an indigenous perspective. Practically, the Yellowstone production team succeed in promoting the objectification of women, misogyny and the need for males to realise their idealised masculine identity through violence and criminal engagement. Overall, disappointingly, what, as a subject, remains as a powerful opportunity to explore the fallacies of American historic cultural narrative, is applied to promote modernist fallacies and prejudices.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur82316881/?ref_=tt_urv

This show isn't as good as Billions as it has too many dueling agendas Ranch owner, property developer, government officials and Reservation chief.
The beauty of Billions is the Chuck-Bobby axis upon which every other character revolves.
This show needs to focus on the man losing his Ranch and one opponent.
Also, too many kid issues that distract from the central plot. Only relationship worth a damn is the one between Kayce and John. Also, would like to see more of his past story fleshed out as Navy SEAL.
The former- SEAL trope has been used a lot lately , but then again the Global War on Terror has seen the number of SEALs grow.
I know a lot of folks are turned off by Beth character, I happen to enjoy Kelly Reilly's portrayal and think she probably enjoys the role, being the bad girl with a purpose. I could do without some of the overt nudity.
We're all adults, we don't really need to see it , to understand it. That's something that's lost in current media. Sex has been used since golden age

tt4236770,ur3030422,7,10 September 2021,"This show started out interesting enough. Season 1 was formulaic but still entertaining. Then comes season 2 - repeat of Season 1 basically. Each season is a repeat of season 1.The entire series is about ""my land"" and everyone else needs to get off of it and don't try to buy or annex or claim with imminent domain, else you'll get killed accidentally.Also, don't go to work for the Yellowstone ranch, because it's like the Hotel California.. you can check out but you cannot leave except on the long black train.There's not really anything else to the story. You have an old sage in Costner. His 3 sons and one daughter who is completely overdone in how much little man syndrome she has. You learn eventually why she's that way, but it's grating to experience her and she adds nothing to the show that a simple high IQ businesswoman with better manners couldn't pull off.The number of deaths on this show is staggering. They cannot breathe without someone getting killed. The kid cannot walk 6 feet from Costner without falling into a river, getting on a snake or getting kidnapped. Poor Kahse cannot even go to the store without needing to shoot someone for any number of reasons, and if there's any reason at all he can imagine to grab his gun and go after someone for anything, he does it.Supposedly the ranch hasn't posted a profit in several years, but everyone has a new truck and they built a new barn and keep hiring people, spending millions on horses. Someone is cooking the books.Let's look at just the deaths into the 3rd season..The mother
The brother
The brother in law
The businessman
The cowboy (train station)
Two kidnappers
Meth cooker
Two assassins
Several white supremicists
Both bad guys
A horse thief
A 17 year old kidon and onThis isn't what ranch life in Montana is like. This isn't even what mafia life in NY is like. There weren't this many killings on the Sopranos. I think the writers just lack ideas and understanding of their audience so they went full on murder flick.It's a decent watch but it leaves you feeling like there are probably 5 characters in total that could float the show and everyone else is simply noise. Beth is really really noise.Then you have to deal with all the plot holes (and there are plenty). What happened to the trip in the plane that had a bomb in it? No idea. How about that wolf that kept watching Kahse and Monica? Did the boy really recover that fast from PTSD by going out to a river and building a camp fire? How did Monica arrange to trap that serial killer guy and did she manage it on her first attempt? What about how mad Monica was going to be when she learned her brother was killed by her husband? That seemed to just fade away. What about Kahse's commitment to rejoin the teams? Never said another word about it. Also, they keep saying he was in the Navy but he has a SEAL trident on his back window. He seems a bit young to be a retired SEAL, and they never actually call him a retired SEAL. I would think if he was going to run for office, being a retired SEAL would be the top of the brochure during a campaign. Also there's no real sense of time passing, bullet wounds seem to magically go away and a busted up face on Beth seems to magically heal between episodes. Jaime's character is poorly written, conflicted is good, but he's not just conflicted. He's completely evil and pathetic. It's odd that Costner adopted a child and then forced him into a profession only to help Costner's corruption. The singing cowboy is misplaced and another character we know really nothing about. The two barrel riders are out of left field. Seems like everyone who's anyone on Texas or Montana ranches got a shot.Odd show.",2,3,/user/ur3030422/?ref_=tt_urv

The backdrop and the camerawork in tandem provide a mesmerizing, immersive viewing experience.On top of that, the writing is excellent. While the show can be a bit humorless at times, its storyline remains compelling enough to keep me engaged, and the characters are beautifully realized, for both good and ill. While so many television writers have forgotten how to write characters who are truly complicated, Linson and Sheridan are not afraid to toy with the audience's affections, providing us with refreshingly consistent, coherent characters who are sympathetic, but not always likeable, well-intentioned if not always virtuous, and who succeed because of their flaws, not in spite of them. In one or two cases, these characters are truly despicable, but in every season so far, the lines between the show's protagonists and its antagonists are blurred to the point of brilliant obscurity.While it does have a tendency to delve into soap-opera style melodrama at some points, Yellowstone remains a viewing experience made by adults for adults, without either devolving into the nihilistic sexualization that many adult shows are prone to, or allowing itself to be tempted by the incessant Hollywood trend towards kiddification.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur109988032/?ref_=tt_urv

In my opinion, this show is beautifully filmed, amazingly acted and has some pretty decent writing. The cast is phenomenal & each hold their own in each episode. Taylor Sheridan has already proved himself as a writer/director with movies such as Wind River (2017), Sicario 1 (2016) + 2 (2018), and Hell or High Water (2015), and Yellowstone (2018) is simply in a similar vein to those amazing films.

Fortunately this didn't have the cheese that SOA had, at least not in the first season.With each preceding season however the show has become more unbelievable and nonsensical, much like SOA. The gritty drama it started out as has devolved into melodramatic manure that reads like fan fiction. It also repeats the same tired and time filling recipe each episode which consists of bunk house shenanigans, a rodeo music montage and Beth being a b**** (that I don't mind).It's become increasingly difficult to get through an episode just to see where the story goes.

tt4236770,ur37326559,3,9 December 2021,"I watched 2 seasons of this cartoonish series, but not sure I can watch any more. It has a lot of stupid random things that happen, and if you can suspend reality and watch it like a cartoon, it can be engaging. However, the plot is amateur at best with no depth. It's basically Cowboys vs Indians with a modern twist.For all the tough cowboy talk, there is heavy melodrama - at any given chance, they start talking about their feelings and whining till the cows come home. Most shows use misplaced drama and forced emotions as fillers when they don't have much substance, and this show is no exception. The writers' confusion is evident with the messy incoherent family dynamics and the misgivings of all involved. It's very childish to put it mildly.Kayce goes through every scene with the same exact expression but ok, he's got a kinda presence. Beth is just annoying and disgusting, and I cringe at every scene she's in. John (Kevin Costner) is a super narcissistic regressive control freak who owns like thousands of acres of pristine land which was probably stolen by his ancestors from the Indians, and yet he has an unholy attachment to it so much so that he'd cross all lines to keep it including the destruction of his family. However, Kevin Costner makes the character tolerable. The moral hypocrisy is all-pervasive. Everyone thinks they are selfless while they are the most selfish except for maybe Rip. Rip, Monica, Lloyd, Jimmy and the Indian chief are the most likeable characters.The alcohol abuse is definitely not good, difficult to understand why these shows and movies glorify such things when they are already huge issues in society. It's disgusting how Beth and some others are always drinking, and they reach for the bottle to cope with the smallest issues. Not a good social message! And what is up with the California bashing? It's way over-the-top - either they're trying to keep it real or they're propagating a right-wing agenda. It's not a good precedent, I have never seen such things in movies/shows before where they're outright bashing another state like this.The series does have some redeeming qualities of humor and heartiness at places, and some of the information about the native genocide is presented quite powerfully including how the destruction of the native lifestyle has also brought about the destruction of the environment and American society as a whole.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur37326559/?ref_=tt_urv

tt4236770,ur8024626,2,24 February 2022,"While I enjoy Yellowstone and currently watching Season 3, there is a constant irritant - the writers are clueless when it comes to the female characters. Take psychotic, suicidal Beth (Reilly) who's in a never ending downward spiral of bitterness toward those around her except her dad (Costner) and Rip (Hauser). If she's not drinking, she's dressing someone down or occassionally carrying out vandalism in a boutique.Then there's miserable, moody Monica (Asbille) who is in a perpetual state of victimhood. If she's not lecturing about the suffering of Native Americans (past and present), she's moaning that her students are on social media too much. And on top of that, she's hates having to live at the Dutton's ranch even though it's better for her young son (Merrill) than at a Reservation. If the writers don't have her down in the dumps, she's required to do sex scenes or stripping off her clothes for a body search. Somebody please give her some happy pills.Briefly, Governor Perry (Moniz) hardly has anything significant to contribute even though she's supposedly a powerful figure. Then there's the female journalist Sarah (Conlin) who gets snuffed out because of Jamie's secrets. Let's not forget also that matriach Evelyn Dutton (Mol) exited early on in season 1. There's the stripper who joined the handlers of the Dutton ranch - for whatever purpose, I'm not sure. And lastly, there's a blonde racist named Veronique (Dunbar) who went out of her way to frame Monica because she didn't like the look of her, for shoplifting and was ultimately humiliated by Beth.So far, these women characters are all cliches, thin as the paper they're written on and are there to serve the political and social agendas of the writers. I read some reviews that this is the least woke series out at the moment but they're being sarcastic, right? Seems to me the positive ratings are for the cinematography, the sentimentalism for the lifestyle of cowboys and the struggle they deal with. That should be enough for many interesting storylines without the graphic violence, gore, political messages and degrading of female characters.",1,5,/user/ur8024626/?ref_=tt_urv
tt4236770,ur94752132,5,4 November 2018,"I've just completed watching the 9 episodes of season 1.
To start with, it is curious to this viewer why would this major production only lasted 9 episodes for its launch?
Taylor Sheridan has a good track record as writer and/or director for such well received films like 'Scario', 'Scario 2', 'Hell & High Water' and 'Wind River'.
Naturally the expectation of this major
TV production head lining with Kevin Costner is high.
The story has a good premise with a lot of possibilities for developing a successful series.
The actors were well casted and each performed competently with iconic Costner little work to do.
Was this series rushed into production leaving the creator/writer/director not enough time to write a complete good
script?
Major story lines were either neglected or underdeveloped while time was wasted by the insignificant side stories.
And what was the reason for that disastrous final episode 9?
It was listless, confusing and maddening for this viewer!

tt4236770,ur25741025,7,13 July 2020,"I REALLY wanted to like this show. The locations and cinematography is flat gorgeous, the cast is solid, and Taylor Sheridan has some stellar writing credits (Sicario, Hell or High Water, Wind River).Coming off the critical success of Wind River, I expected more of the same: honest character development without overt moralizing. Unfortunately, that was not to be. In Yellowstone, the protagonists are all fairly unlikable characters made accessible by attractive actors.Sheridan unfortunately feels the need to hit the audience over the head with a hammer. Costner's character John Dutton is frequently given to pithy comments like ""As free as a man can be"" while gazing out at the thousands of acres he inherited. Or ""Who's going to feed America when the ranchers are gone"" without a hint of irony. (Frankly, a few fewer cheeseburgers in the typical American's diet might go a long way to helping our national obesity problem.)The recent show had the ranchers clash with a small group of California-based bikers. The ONLY reason for the biker's appearance in the show was to give the ranchers a group of bad men (Cali bad, Montana good) to beat up and intimidate. Sheridan keeps coming back to the same right-wing theme: California is bad, the good guys are from places like Montana and Wyoming, and transplants are clueless city folk who drink overly fancy coffee. Virtually ALL of Yellowstone's villains are from California, which is not a coincidence.Not a show for young viewers. Lots of violence, some occasional nudity.

The story/plot lines are complex & almost always there are opposing forces in play that further add to this complexity, yet it is so masterfully produced that it is actually easy to follow. Each episode leaves you wanting to see the next one immediately!I have owned, ridden, trained & shown western-use horses all my life & have been around cattle operations as well. The producers do a good job for the most part with the handling of the horses and in using authentic western saddles & tack. The set-up of the ranch is mostly believable as well. Sure there are some unrealistic things here & there, but it's television, not real life. Nothing worth nit-picking and certainly heads above what you usually see in western-themed television or big-screen movies.The cinematography is wonderful, illustrating the grandeur of the Montana landscape as well as the action scenes with the horses/riders.The acting is superb. Kevin Costner plays ranch owner & father John Dutton, a hard but fair man that expects much from his children and hired hands. Cole Hauser plays his ranch foreman, Rip, who is deeply devoted to John. John's children, played by Kelly Reilly, Luke Grimes and Wes Bentley couldn't be more different from one another and often find their personal aspirations in conflict with their duty to their father and which often put them at odds with one another.One side note: Because of the format used, the viewer needs to watch the first couple of episodes before they will be familiarized with the characters.

Sound familiar? But wait, there's more!Three (remaining) children: A son, Jamie, who, no matter how hard he tries, or how good his intentions are, always finds himself on the outside looking in, ostracized from his family, and (at least up until season 2), ending up exiled entirely to the point where he is faced with the real possibility of ultimate family betrayal. (Fredo)A son, Kasey, torn between two seemingly irreconcilable worlds, trying to belong to both and neither at the same time, ultimately realizing that he must choose one or the other and (at least at the end of the first season) has chosen to come home and help lead the family. If you need more hints as to which ""Godfather"" sibling I'm comparing him to, well gosh, he's a war hero AND he's married to a schoolteacher!! (Michael)And that leaves my favourite child, Beth. (Sorry, I think Kelly Reilly is doing an absolutely amazing job, by the way) Beth. Foul-mouthed. Ruthless. And, most importantly, I think she believes she's absolutely indestructible. This is (Sonny) using power, attitude and a sharp tongue instead of fists, and I'd almost debate which form of attack is more deadly.I love this show, but I haven't started season 2 yet, and after reading some of the other commentary on here, it sounds like ""Yellowstone"" is starting to veer into socialist soapboxery.

tt4236770,ur28110221,8,4 December 2021,"First let's just say that I like the series, and it is definitely one of the better series out there today. That being said it is much more flawed than the fans lead to believe, some even saying its better than the likes of Breaking Bad or sopranos? That is what got my attention, and I binge watched the whole thing, only to be slightly disappointed on my expectations.First off the main reason I don't think this series is even close to be the best series out there is the fact that most scenes do not feel natural, and its not really the actors fault they all act fairly great with Costner being the obvious best actor here, but it's the fault of the writing and overdramatization in my opinion. Some characters feel pretty off to what they were stablished to be on the earlier seasons, and no it is not character growth, character growth needs to make sense, and sometimes it just doesn't.The other thing that annoys mostly revolves around the character of Beth, she is such a wild card always doing and saying random things that I believe the producers try to make it seem like a mic drop scene, but it doesn't land for me, quite the opposite she sometimes look forced and awkward. To their credits, there are many other scenes where that effect does work, never masterfully, but mostly never with Beth.Finally the last big fault it has for me is lack of logic on many scenes, but I can't really say examples without spoiling it, suffice to say it sometimes feels like a teenage drama by inserting random dramatic stuff that don't ever really have any consequence or even growth.I wish this series was as good as some people claim it is, but it just isn't, I had a similar effect with Peaky Blinders, good but not that good, some good scenes but not enough to be at the top, there are many other series better than this.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur28110221/?ref_=tt_urv

At times a dark, bleak and grim drama (don't let that dissuade you... this show's amazing), on the struggle between a modern ranch, its cowboys, and local natives who seek a change to the oppression experienced for centuries. Greed combines with the struggle of politics and those of personal vendettas and relations, making this series one of intrigue and entertainment. The cinematography representing the Montana landscape is truly beautiful to behold. If nothing else, many will appreciate that alone. You will laugh, tear up, and maybe even grind your teeth and grip your arm chair with a fury as you watch the characters you'll come to love and hate go through innumerable trials and tragedies. One of today's greatest cinematic masterpieces which is sure to captivate many. This isn't just a boring ""cowboys and Indian"" show. It isn't all violence either. It will make you think. It will make you FEEL and if it doesn't, it probably isn't for you. Give it a couple episodes before judging. This isn't cheap entertainment. This is well scripted, well thought out, well acted television. TV at its best.In a time when much of Hollywood seems insistent on pushing very in your face ""woke"" content, gender/race/sexuality swapping, sequel after sequel, remake after remake... you get a fresh quality television show with a broad cast of characters. I've never seen anything like it. No politics in your face. No woke agenda. It's nice to see a show that focuses on making ""quality"" content, rather than just delivering a message while delivering a limp and lame script like so many shows seem to be doing.

The whole Jimmy thing adds up to nothing and his sex scenes were cringe worthy. Who wants to see him having sex? Geezus. Then they bring in the new kid, a 13 yr old who ends up living on the ranch shoveling horse manure. Oh boy! That went nowhere.The writers lost their minds with this script. This was 10 excruciating hours of waiting for something, anything, to happen. But nothing ever happened. The entire plot was around Beth and her constant desire to get back at her brother. A Beth visit to the penitentiary was one of the dumbest and most uneventful scenes in the final episode. She fools him into seeing her only to tell him in a long dribbling diarrhea of the mouth dialog that he will rot in jail. Well gee thanks for wasting 15 minutes of the final episode on something that again adds up to nothing. Oh wait, we found out it was her brother.

Beth in particular--I cannot recall ever liking her kind of character so much. Kelly Reilly will hopefully win some kind of award.
One thing I've noticed is there seems to be a bit of a correalation between John Dutton and Vito Corleone that goes beyond just being rich, powerful men.
Both are heads of families with three boys, one girl. The oldest son dies. The middle son is somewhat effeminate and not as tough as his family. The youngest is the rebel but seems to be possibly the heir apparent. The daughter and the wives are not part of the similarity however.
Both have a tough enforcer who is totally devoted to the boss. Both fight against other interests in the area and have 'soldiers' at their command.

 I liked Kelly Reilly in L'auberge Espagnole, but in this she looks like a hooker or domestic violence victim or someone strung out on drugs and/or alcohol (or all the above) which makes her role/performance less credible and sympathetic (for me). A similar series (Western genre-wise) would be the first Lonesome Dove with a super cast (Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall and many others), which was surely a bonafide 10.

The overarching storyline is fine and the scenery is enchanting. On the plot-level however, it's often incredibly stupid. The amount of convenient coincidences and freak accidents in this show is farcical. There are lots of speeches and moral lessons being uttered, but the characters' actions speak differently, and you get the feeling as though this hypocricy is not intentional. There's an uncountable number of murders being comitted only to be forgotten about a second later. Very rarely can it be said that the main characters act in self-defence, but the show just lets them off the hook morally and legally, unless they're Jamie - the show's punching bag. It's just the Montana way, I guess. Why do I keep watching? I don't know. I guess, it's the setting.

Another reviewer here well said, ""The viewer is asked to admire the extreme cruelty, torture and murder committed by this atrocious fictional family of ranchers."" They are not cowboys: they are outlaws. This idiotic cult branding of humans and murdering anybody that just wants to move on to another job, the intent of recruitment of ranch hands, branded, to pimp them for murderous, criminal ends? That daughter that is psycho whacked beyond explicable?They spend the first two seasons showing how the ranch is just little mafia on the range, then move into the third season, trying to rehabilitate these monsters, by showing their family side of relations, doing some camping, etc. How ludicrous this somehow makes up for having the moral fiber of rabid dogs. Also, how idiotic it is that the patriarch is obsessed with keeping land his family cannot forever afford, how idiotic any man can dictate a covetous dynasty, that murders anybody standing the way of a few people, coveting vast land resources, as if they're entitled, forever, to land was first stolen from Native Americans, that held it 10,000 years or whatever. It's moronic beyond the pale that the patriarch is hanging on to the promise to his father not to part with an inch of land, like he's so moral his word reigns supreme, while, out of the other side of his mouth, he's a vicious, narcissistic, ruthless murderer, trying to dictate into eternity. It's also a real fool that would meet his Maker, having run Murder, Inc., to covet land that is, bottom line, owned by his Maker, in the first place.The show is a modern, morass of evil, that little accounts for the God fearing cowboys that know what an outlaw is. We all know they're simply trying to throw up on the screen moral ambiguity, to confuse the distinction between good guys and bad guys, Hollywood's mission to make things bitter sweet, things dark light, in the never ending slide deeper into the abyss that happily will call such degeneracy art and entertainment. The show is another violent, morally ambiguous piece of the unmentionable, where, that, by season 2, at the latest, 95.7% of the characters needed to eat the unmentionable and die, or somebody mercifully drop a nuke on the ranch and stop another season getting vomited of this degenerate assault on civilization Hollywood calls art.Seriously, I fear maybe I haven't realized the person that recommended this show to me is a psycho.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur105859484/?ref_=tt_urv

This is essentially 'The Sopranos' in cowboy hats, but with mediocre dialogue, over the top acting (probably to make up for the dialogue), and psychopaths who are far less engaging and likeable than those homicidal New Jersey ne'er-do-wells. This slow-paced series feels like a soap opera at times, with every line of dialogue from Costner delivered as long, self-aggrandizing speeches (which typically you may encounter once in an entire movie) from an aging, murderous sociopath pontificating / moralizing about family values and his megalomaniacal entitlement to half the land in Montana, whilst branding his employees and wantonly killing people they don't like. You'd be hard pressed to find a single character in the whole show who's not completely reprehensible, or even remotely interesting. The genius of shows like 'Breaking Bad' and 'Ozark' is that while the characters are deeply flawed, morally conflicted and mired in criminal activity, you find yourself rooting for them because they come across as sympathetic underdogs, unlike this deplorable band of unsavory narcissists. I've always liked Costner, even when critics didn't (3000 Miles To Graceland, Three Days to Kill, Criminal) but it feels like he's mailing it in here, and no amount of postage is likely to redeem this hollow protagonist, and I'm flummoxed that Taylor Sheridan is a head writer on this (Sicario, Hell or High Water, Wind River). Coupled with his last movie 'Those Who Wish Me Dead' starring Angelina Jolie, I get the disheartening sense his mojo streak as a writer is waning. The edge has dulled. All hat, no cattle?

I enjoyed the first episode which set things up, and having now watched all three seasons I can honestly say the whole series has been outstanding. A couple of episodes in series 3 were a little slow, but that doesn't matter as there is so much action in other episodes it's nice to slow things down. The music is excellent, the scenery is outstanding, the acting is top notch, and the stories are well paced. Costner is superb as John Dutton, he looks born for this part, and is totally convincing in all his scenes.

At first I thought they were complicated characters, but no, they are all just evil and greedy, that's disappointing. What kept me watching is that the dad is biased to some of his children, and he treats them like assets, yet they keep protecting his land for no reason. Some characters had strong morals at first then they fill victim to the twisted mentality of the dad, but it's unfortunate the show doesn't address that properly. Some things don't make sense, for example the native Americans are playing minor roles? and we're supposed to hate them even though they are fighting for good values and aren't as socio as the main family.

Costner is at the top of his game here. He plays the patriarch of the family flawlessly and the rest of the cast is excellent as well, playing characters that are well conceived and plausible.

Writing is strong - but again, if you're looking for absolute realism you may want to look elsewhere.

tt4236770,ur2222565,8,9 December 2021,"So, I'm all caught up after my son told me that I should watch it. I'm glad he did, but, I'm a little pissed too. It's really tough to simply turn the show off and get to bed. Suffice to say, I haven't had much sleep lately and that might show in my writing.Yellowstone is a little like GOT in that the bad guy becomes the good guy and then a bad guy later. I like dramas that blur the line between good and bad, it's much more human and more relevant to the human condition. Voldemort nailed it, ""There's no good or evil, only power and those too afraid to seek it."" That sums up this series.While, for the most part, the performances are brilliant, I do have issue with how the female characters are portrayed. They become too predictable. Each female character has some psychosis that makes them incapable of rational behavior. While I enjoy the nuisances, and poking fun at women, this show takes it a bit too far as there are really no women who you care to idolize. They come close to creating a character in Beth Dutton, who, at times demonstrates capabilities that I admire, but, then the crazy comes out and undermines it all. This seems to be a common theme in the show and if you see a woman, just know, she's going to be crazy too.My other complaint are the constant dramatic soliloquies in a slow western drawl. These attempt to be insightful and profound, but, instead of teaching a lesson, these snap us from the realities of their world to that fact that this is only a TV drama and I'm watching actors in a TV show.Reading some of the other reviews made me giggle. I understand that personal politics influences how you see the world, I do, but, if you let yourself get into the series, you can begin to identify with the differences in culture between urban and rural life. The series demonstrates a conflict between Native American and American values. I don't see that conflict as preachy. One reviewer mentioned that he felt the series was too ""woke"" because the Native Americans expressed that, ""one man should not own this much land."" That sentiment was re-expressed by a Chinese tourist as well. But, in both cases, the show allowed you to feel the conflict between how each culture perceives this and how land ownership is something we value in the USA. In the end, I found myself feeling annoyed at the objections against land ownership.Politics do take part in the show and I appreciate the perspectives and the conflicts that it portrays. It doesn't seem like the show takes sides, instead, the characters take sides and it's up to the viewer to understand the conflict and create there own alliances. I think it's this that most people don't like. Graying the lines between black and white makes people feel ""icky"" and they don't want to understand the others perspective. It's too much work.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur2222565/?ref_=tt_urv

Where was the passion, the fire, he almost seemed disinterested in even portraying the character. 
The cattle, really, wandering cattle evoke an armed conflict of military proportions between Native Americans and rich ranchers, seriously?? Oh, and the river, well we can just put some strategically placed TNT along the stream and divert it, huh, to where?
In retrospect, I'd rather have watched pretty much anything else for those two hours last evening.
Yellowstone missed the mark on pretty much everything. Poorly acted, disappointing filmography, disjointed segments and a plot that more resembled Sci-Fi than a modern day western...no thank you, I'll take a show like Longmire any day.",61,112,/user/ur30950646/?ref_=tt_urv

Hard working men with vision. Uber rich or poor. Making hard choices and standing behind them, come what may.
I love seeing the people who own and work for this ranch to keep it successful. Many times I would like to imitate Beths' actions but know better. But it is very satisfying to see her set things right.
Dutton is a fair but hard man doing what's necessary to keep and hand down the family ranch. Fighting the elements and those who would try to take all that his family has sacrificed to maintain.
The scenery and wildlife is breath taking and easy to see why they fight so hard to hold onto their land and why so many scheme to take it. The land itself is a character in this series.
Each of the characters here have depth and are well developed, so as to understand why they are the way they are. Time is taken for their pasts to be revealed, whether they are ranch hands or family, as they all fight for what is theirs.
There are few whiners and snowflakes here and those that are don't last long. These are the ones who fight to take this land just because they don't want them to have it, but want them to share it with those who have neither worked nor invested for it.

This show is on the same level - or higher.I assume the reviewers dumping on this show are expecting plotlines like the westerns they watched growing up.

Kevin Costner is John Dutton, patriarch of a mega-ranch in Montana with three sons and a daughter, every one of them dysfunctional. After watching season one it's easy to see why.If you think Costner is a Ben Cartwright clone, think again. He's more like Don Vito Corleone; Papa Dutton controls everyone and everything in the state, while his kids are more Dallas soap opera like. Oldest son Jamie is the family attorney with no backbone, bailing everyone out of constant trouble. Middle son Lee doesn't make it past the first episode, so his story is never told. Youngest son Kayce has major anger issues and hates his father enough that he and his Native American wife live on the reservation. Daughter Beth, the most unlikeable villainess, is an alcoholic with mommy issues who never emotionally matured. Then there is the ranch's majordomo Rip, aka the Enforcer. He helps get rid of Dutton's enemies or anyone who ever done him wrong. Once you're in the family or work on the ranch you never leave, at least not alive.I find it hard to believe that any successful ranching operation of that magnitude would be so dysfunctional.

I might be being a little harsh since the reviews are so glowing when it's not warranted but this show is very overrated.
The dialogue is kind of cheesy. As the show goes on, you learn more backstories which are pretty melodramatic. The pretty female character, while being a modest character is somehow in her underwear 1-2 times per season while literally nobody else ever is.
In season 2, Kevin Costner decides to kill the two brothers, then doesn't act on it and waits for his grandson to get kidnapped THEN reacts. There are a multitude of plot holes but this one bugged me the most.
The wardrobe is hilariously bad. These cowboys are always well groomed with brand new clothing. The scene that killed me is the one where the bikers are camping on the ranch and they all have brand new T-shirts under their brand new vests. It was too much 😂

Season 4 was a wasteland of painful and incongruent plot lines that were complete departures for the characters and previous storylines the worst being introducing Piper Perabo as the tree hugger who seduces Kevin Costner. You've GOT to be kidding! Jamie, his dad and the mother of his long lost child were second worst. So random, so ill conceived, so utterly dissatisfying.The dialog got progressively worse throughout the season and left me wishing that the writers for ""Days of our Lives"" would magically appear and wrest the pens from the fingers of whoever was responsible. Thankfully, the interminably lengthy landscape shots and bad cowboy sing alongs prevented even more dialog from poisoning the well.It's time to do the humane thing and either shoot this horse and put it out of its misery or fire the handlers and turn it over to a writing and production staff who cares enough to treat and train this thoroughbred like it was born to perform.",6,10,/user/ur77719889/?ref_=tt_urv

But where The Sopranos, as one example, redeemed its sociopathic tones and characters with inferred context, Yellowstone fails. Yellowstone simply is what it is; a shallow, transparent train-wreck of amoral, vindictive narcissists. It achieves nothing more... short of filling the screen with some of the most magnificent vistas the US has to offer. The only exceptions to this train-wreck of narcissism and sociopathy are the characters of Monica and her grandfather. Yet both are glaringly absent in S2.

tt4236770,ur148552718,9,19 January 2022,"Simply put, the first chapter of ""Yellowstone"" is actually a detailed exposition: there are more questions than answers, there are plenty of options for the development of the action. Moreover, you can move along the time line in both directions - from flashbacks telling about the childhood of Dutton's offspring, you can make a separate mini-series. Such a composition may have a right to exist, but the way Sheridan crumpled up the intermediate finale suggests a bad idea: it looks like he just didn't have enough timing to bow out beautifully before the intermission. In this regard, the first season looks like a banner, the length of which was not enough to beautifully depict the intended phrase on it, and therefore in the end we had to reduce the letters - in the last episode they stick to each other, like a negligent schoolboy. The code of the season looks especially ridiculous in comparison with its first half, where Sheridan generously, with Old Testament enthusiasm, sends troubles to the members of the Dutton family, risking depriving his story of credibility and reclassifying it from a novel into a parable. However, the event density of the first episodes is also deceptive: of course, it does not let you get bored, but, again, ""Yellowstone"" at the same time gives the impression of a training ground for screenwriters - when you can sketch the strings of several plots just in terms of warming up for the imagination, without worrying too much about what to do next with these applications.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur148552718/?ref_=tt_urv

Yellowstone is one of the finest examples of this. I'm a big fan of Taylor Sheridan and this show only strengthens my appreciation and awe for his writing. Sicario was an instant favourite of mine while Wind River is fantastic too.
As ever, the dialogue he writes here is phenomenal; proper heavyweight fayre, but not so heavy to the point that you're left with your head spinning after watching one episode too many.
The cast clearly relishes chewing through scenes with the stuff he writes, and who could blame them??
The cast are heavyweight too; I've always been a huge Costner fan and to say that this show continues his renaissance as an actor would be very unfair to Yellowstone, because there's a very valid argument that this is the best work he's ever done, perhaps only tying with Dances, and Wyatt Earp, the latter being one of my all-time favorite movies.
Luke Grimes, Cole Hauser, Kelly Reilly and Wes Bentley all support him perfectly making this one of the best casts in television right now.
Sheridan directs too and needless to say simply a writer, he ain't. He makes full use of the gorgeous, sweeping locations at his disposal to really help immerse us in the world of the big ranch.
This show is not for everyone though, it has some dark themes and regularly lays bare the fragility of life, the despair of living and the evil men can do to other men.
That being said, it's hugely rewarding, and more touching family moments serve to cast a beam of light on some of the darker places this show takes us.

tt4236770,ur60992520,10,20 November 2018,"Well, I guess you'd have to say it was Taylor Sheridan, and, let me tell you, he was RIGHT!
This is some of the most impressive scriptwriting I've seen in...ever. The characters are well drawn, meticulously understood by the writer, with each and every nook, cranny, misanthrope or fracture ready to be drawn upon as needed, to simultaneously crush with emotional disturbance, and make you understand what is at stake, in the heart achingly beautiful reality of Yellowstone. Because, this story happens right in the bosom of the real star of the show: the land, surrounded by purple mountain majesties, evergreens and wide open spaces. As John Dutton says early on, ""if a man had all the money in the world, this is what he would buy."" For land, particularly undeveloped, pristine, wild land in the American West, is a limited thing. When it's gone, it's gone, and everybody knows that.John Dutton, the patriarch and owner of Yellowstone ranch, has created a true disaster from a lifetime of being the hard, taciturn master that was required. This robbed his children of the time and admiration of a loving father, which is what they would buy if hey had all the money in the world.Now, they're grown, and it's too late. In his final years, when he wants to make amends and play with his grandkids, his children all hate him for their own personal reasons, and in many ways, can't wait for him to be gone so they can just do away with this huge chunk of land that has been a prison for their entire lives. They all want to move on, but can't cut loose of the past, especially when its reins are the hands of their powerful, ruthless father.The way Mr. Sheridan started killing off major characters in the first episode, I was beginning to wonder if anybody would be left for the rest of the season. He had it right, though. By the end of the pilot, I was completely convinced that no one in this move is safe. Just because you're a major star doesn't mean you won't end up dead before the end of any episode. Being a character in a Taylor Sheridan script is dangerous. Many don't make it. Because the story may require their death to proceed. Very similar to real life, when you think about it.Although every character in Yellowstone is fascinating, the one that gets to me the most is Beth Dutton, John's only daughter, played by Kelly Reilly. Perfectly cast with Reilly, Beth is a tortured soul, carrying a guilt about her mother's death, and a hardness pounded into her by her mother and father. Now a voluptuous but aging woman, she's extremely intimidating, capable and completely captivating. She's a woman who has no boundaries, no shame, and no patience for weakness. She consumes men like a Black Widow spider, with a cynical smile. When daddy needs her, however, she's on the next plane, and her first question is ""Just tell me who to fight."" Daddy says ""Everyone."" And she does.Beth is John Dutton's secret weapon, like a nuclear smart bomb he can release on those who need to be taken down. She's capable of evil, which none of John Dutton's other children seem to be. Evil is what John is going to need to win the battle to hold on to his way of life, and leave a legacy for his family.Beth is a seething, broken person, with the brand of Yellowstone on the inside, where nobody sees it. She's a train wreck, and the question that hangs in the air around her is, will this woman destroy us all, or save us, like a gladiator? By the end of the first season, I'm not sure. That's why I'll be downloading season 2 as soon as its available.My next favorite character is Tate Dutton, (Brecken Merrill), son of Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes), the youngest of John Dutton's children. Tate's mom is an Indian girl, Monica Dutton, well played by Kelsey Asbille.Tate, age 6 or so, is a real badass. Here's a kid who is growing up on an Indian reservation in Utah, with a white father who has somehow stolen the heart of a beautiful Indian girl and their love has created this beautiful, brave little boy. This makes him an outcast as an Indian and as a white kid. He's a real fighter, an attribute I would guess he's going to need in upcoming seasons, as he grows up and becomes more a part of the fight. The two sides of his family tree, Indian and Dutton, are enemies. Always have been. Now, the Indian nation has vowed to get the land back from the white intruders. This young kid, Tate, is going to be right in the middle of it. I can't wait to see how Sheridan develops this character. It's going to be fun. And this young actor Brecken Merrill, is up for the task. Some of his moments on screen steal the show from everybody. You can't take your eyes off this kid. He's phenomenal.What I'm struck by the most in ""Yellowstone"" is the richness of the story. The trusty ol' cowboys and Indians trope is redefined and brought into the 21st century, with characters that are unique, and believable. Nothing seems staged or forced. It's just, simply, what would John Dutton do in a situation like this? Or Beth? Or Tate? Good or bad, the story lives with the consequences, and marches on down its inevitable path to destruction.
There's going to be a lot of dead people. Some might even deserve it. When you pit 3 opposing forces against each other - the land owner, the Indians, and the encroaching land developers - who all hate to lose, and play for keeps, things are going to get ugly. There may not even be a good guy or a bad guy at the end, no matter the color of their hats.It may just all be wrong, it may be that these people are trying to deal with horrors committed by their ancestors, with resentment and hatred that has gone on too long and can't be fixed. You see this sort of thing causing wars, terrorism, refugees, atrocities all over the globe, due to the clashes of differing races, religions or cultures.Well, it happened in America as well. We just try not to think about it all that much. Thanks to Taylor Sheridan, the spotlight is now turned on.
I can't wait to see what happens next in Sheridan's Yellowstone, a fascinating and entertaining new story about The American West.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur60992520/?ref_=tt_urv

tt4236770,ur72634086,5,21 July 2021,"It is about a rancher family that is broken by the death of their mother or wife. Something that every family has to deal with sooner or later. The fact that they still haven't managed to do that after about 20 years seems a bit strange to me and I have difficulty understanding it.But anyway, let's start with the different storylines, unfortunately I have similar problems with each of them as with the death of the mother above.1. an investor wants to build (luxury) houses / apartments on his land. The patriarch of the family John Dutton is strictly against it. The reason for this remains completely unclear.I am not a rancher, but I see no disadvantages here but only advantages. E.g. Horse farms for the rich families, cowboy vacations etc. Or just not.2. the Indian chief drove John's cows onto the reservation to provoke an incident. John, who is supposed to be a capable company boss, knows this too and still attacks the Indians with his cowboys. Instead of bribing some Indians to drive the cattle back, for example, or doing something much smarter.The reason for this is probably that the scriptwriters are overtaxed to drive the plot forward in a different way. Because John loses a son in the process and tensions arise between him and the reservation.3. john takes in the drug-addicted son of a acquaintance who is first systematically humiliated. Among other things, they strap him onto a wild horse. I actually know something about riding, and the boy could have died in the process. Presumably, after his ordeal, he is then taken into the bosom of the family, but by then i couldn't watch it anymore. Of course, the boy was ""branded"" with a branding iron, as were all the members of the family. This made an extremely primitive impression, are coboys supposed to be like that?4. the youngest son shoots several people in the first few episodes (not without reason). But then, for example, he doesn't think it's necessary to call the police, and he shoots another person so that he doesn't have to suffer? Wtf? Is that how it's done in America? With another he is suspected of murder after he has shot him 5 times in the chest (that was still self-defense) and then shot him in the head (that was then according to the series the murder). The guy is supposed to be an excellent soldier. Why does he shoot someone he has shot 5 times in the chest still in the head (what for?). And even if, the victim had nevertheless with 5 chest shots at all no more survival chance, how can that be then murder.I found it very unfortunate that I was not able to understand the motivations of the actors.",2,8,/user/ur72634086/?ref_=tt_urv

It would be helpful since the director is a cowboy himself, he would keep those things true to form, but he probably does it to move the story along.
For all you Beth haters.....I think she is the best part of the series. She is the JR Ewing of the group. If any woman has ever had to compete for the approval and attention of her father against her brothers, especially in a family business, she will understand Beth completely. To prove herself worthy and as good as a son, she has to be smarter, more cunning, more ruthless and more savvy than the boys and Beth does a remarkable job of it. On top of that, she feels she is responsible for her mother's death and that is eating her up, so she strikes out. Her acting in the scene where she is beat up and almost raped was epic. I could watch that over and over. And, I really liked seeing the protective, yet vicious side of her in the scene with the ritzy shop that harasses her Native American sister-in-law. And she is so tender and spicy with Rip. The many sides and moods and temperaments of her, I feel are brilliantly played.
Costner is yummy, yummy as a cowboy and even more hot when he is on a horse and I find the grizzled older gray haired cowboy has a pretty strong sex appeal also. Rip is one tough MF and I love to see him get angry and handle someone. And then there is the wussy, whiny, stupid, screw-up brother, also acted very well as he is definitely the loser you love to hate, yet sometimes you have to feel sorry for him also.

At it's core it's a struggle centered around some very heavy social issues, without being preachy or heavy handed.Anyone who has history or a love of the west will most likely love this, the settings are beautiful and will remind you of what you remember growing up or visiting this area. Growing up around Deadwood, SD, its no secret Kevin Costner has a great love of this area and he does it justice in this series.If you aren't hooked by the second episode, this isn't for you. I can understand someone growing up in an urban area never having first hand experience in this country not taking to this series, but having family in the rodeo, relatives that used to break wild horses, run cattle, ranches, etc, there is truth to a lot that is told here.Obviously there is hyperbole and poetic license with some of the concepts, but at its core, I never stop being impressed how they make the plots and story lines compelling without preaching or explaining everything as if they were fishing for approval.At the end of the day, I am glad people like Kevin Costner take the time to put together things like this for others to enjoy. Had a friend not mentioned it at a party, I would have never run across it, and I literally drive through these settings every year to my parents place in the Black Hills in SD.Regarding volume issues I see reported, I purchased on Microsoft Movies and have a 5.2.1 surround system and it sounded great.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur12763535/?ref_=tt_urv

tt4236770,ur128552012,7,19 January 2021,"Yellowstone: What do you do when you love the scenic setting and the genre, like the interesting plot lines and characters, but hate the dialogue? Every second word by every character is F. Except the kid, and you know he is not far behind in that toxic verbal environment. Besides larding dialogue down with constant repetitious expletives, there were many missed opportunities for great dialogue to expand audience understanding about the issues the characters are facing. Example: Monica's one sided rhetoric about Indian injustices starting with Columbus, and ignoring the fact that the Indians also murdered and enslaved each other before and after Columbus. Everybody stole, murdered and enslaved anybody weaker. But never mind Columbus. Every player in this drama is doing unrelieved evil also. Except the kid. Yet. A lot of violence, a lot of murder, a lot of vigilante 'justice', completely morally dark, no humor anywhere, death everywhere. No consequences. No character trying to do the right thing or getting nailed by the law. Murder, assault, and adultery are wonderful, lying and coveting are fine. The main characters are depicted as heroic for standing up to their values by offing anyone getting in the way of those values; all are doing bad things to attain a good goal. Except the kid. Revenge is a way of life. I was left wondering, How old were the writers? Only the scenery, setting, plot, and characters such as they are kept us watching. Kevin Costner is fantastic as the crusty pragmatic clannish rancher. And the showing of the work of ranching was well done and realistic. But again, the producers missed an opportunity for balance. Multiple times we the audience hear the sentiment of ""no one man should own all this land"" without presenting the responsibility, the risk, the danger and importance of food production, and the skill of getting usable calories out pasturage that can't be farmed, and that ranchers are preserving large tracts of land. Public national parks get trashed by overuse by the public; private ranches preserve for food production large areas of land and keep the areas untrammeled.

I keep routing for each one with their issues and feel disappointed when they do something they shouldn't. Would Jesus be pleased with me for watching this? Probably not, but in many ways (much less violent ways) those characters are no different than people across the spectrum everywhere today - who just hide their dirtiness better & attack issues (generally) in a less violent way, though they are still very damaged individuals. I am disappointed in the 'woke' aspect that keeps popping up, why are the women such nasty power hungry evil ladies, (except Monica who at least acts like a woman of integrity) is that part of the equal women thing? Really not liking the women in the bunkhouse, that whole storyline is pretty stupid having them act like rowdy men & bed hopping while the men are acting somewhat girlie.

I have no clue why it's necessary to continue to include the character of Jimmy and his story in the series; it contributes nothing to the overall plot. All of the sex and f-bombs that have been added are 100% unnecessary, all the extra ranch hands that have been added are extraneous and unnecessary. It does not make the show cutting edge or add anything positive, and adding a young boy who talks about his balls and uses the f-bomb every other sentence--actually makes me respect the show even less.

In front of the house there is a children's playground and a small garden. In the evening I like to sit in the garden and watch children playing.Our flat is on the fourth floor. It is a big and nicely furnished flat. There are four rooms in it: a living room and three bedrooms. Our living room is just across the corridor on the right. Here you can see a bookcase and a nice cupboard. There is also a sofa and two armchairs in the room. The curtains a beautiful thick carpet and nice pictures on the walls make this room cozy. We often sit here in the evening, watch TV and drink tea with biscuits. My mother is fond of reading, she often sits here in her favourite armchair and reads a book.As for me, my favourite place is my bedroom, which is my study. Our bed¬rooms are furnished very much alike. There is a sofa, a wardrobe a desk and some bookshelves there. The only difference is the colour and style. If you enter my room, you'll know much about me. There are a lot of photos on the walls. As I like to travel, I bring many photos from each country, I visit. The best of them hang on the walls. My desk stands near the window, and it is the best place to work for me in our flat. When I get tired, I often sit on the sofa and listen to my favourite music.But my brother likes our kitchen. He likes the smell of our mother's apple pie and everything she cooks for us. Our kitchen is rather big, so everyone has their favourite place here. We often sit around our table and discuss our family life. We also have our meals in the kitchen. We often gather here in the morning and in the evening to have breakfast and supper or have a snack.

A less-than-stellar foray into television's two-decades-long obsession with the antihero, ""Yellowstone"" features a collection of dull-witted characters whose personalities range from awful to detestable. This in and of itself would not necessarily be a deal-breaker, if the series were as smart as, say, ""Succession.""

For the most part the characters are fully realized with each actor doing great justice to their role. The downside for me is the overarching plot of every season begins to get repetitive with someone new trying to take over the Yellowstone every season. Last but not least is I'm hopeful the events of the last episode(3.10) aren't an indicator of things to come. My biggest worry when I started this show was that the show runner previously acted on sons of anarchy. It was my hope he wouldn't run his show like soa which to me had a problem with every episode having a shootout and deaths. The violence becomes numbing and it really looses its luster when each episode does the same thing. So far for the most part Yellowstone has kept the violence mostly at bay while not being devoid of violence at least there's a semblance of responsibility on the writers part and not to show violence with no consequence.

SPOILERSIn the internet age and with the plethora of advisors available for fact checking. It is beyond ridiculous that such idiotic gun plots would be written, let alone filmed. While possible to swap parts between weapons, as done is episode two. To do this to cover up a crime, would be pointless. There are four major parts when field stripping the Glock. Five if you count the magazine and three of them have matching serial numbers. The cop and the ex-military bad ass would know this and not even consider doing it. As all it does is bring attention to the weapon and then they both have some explaining to do. Especially the cop. As to the crime and it is a crime. Nobody is going to ""put down"" somebody just because they are in pain(what pain? all his nerve ends are burned off and he's going into shock.) and expect it is legal. Who would even consider it for anyone but a loved one? We are to believe he would risk his freedom just because his wife gives him the OK, for a drug user/dealer/cooker who just killed his entire family? As a combat vet, he also knows that the guy is going to bleed out in a few minutes anyhow from the missing leg. I can suspend my disbelief only so far.I'm almost tempted to continue watching to see if that weapon was the one he used to kill his brother-in-law.

I had really high hopes for this show but as the season came to an end, it really wasn't what I thought it was going to be. The daughter is very mentally ill, unstable, trashy, vulgar, disgusting, foul, slutty, and horrible to her lawyer brother. Everyone in the family basically just uses the lawyer brother as they need and then treat him very badly even though he fixes their problems. His Father beats him up and kicks him out of the family for something very minor in my opinion. The family favors a different brother who seems to kill people like crazy and screws things up for them all the time. And then there is another brother who dies pointlessly. The Father is a corrupt murderer who will do anything for his family but he has no real love or fatherly bonds with any of them. So no one appreciates anything he does. And no one cares about the family ranch he is trying to hold on to for them. He is dying of cancer and everything seems to be going downhill for the family because no one really cares about each other. It just feels like by the end of the season, all of the crap they go through is pointless and you dont even like anyone anyway. You dont know who to feel sorry for or who deserves the ranch and property. Because the show doesn't help you to connect emotionally with anyone. And then they make the Natives look corrupt and greedy and selfish and you kind of hate them too. But the show does do a good job of showing what it's like on some of the reservations around the United States. My own family comes from reservations very similar to the ones on Yellowstone. So the way they portray the poverty and drug use is very accurate and so sad. I was hoping the Natives in the writing would have been different, like more honest Tribal Leaders really making a difference for their people. But not one person.... is a good human being at all. And I am meaning every character on the show!So in all, just a downer show. Which is a bummer because the actors are all amazing and the scenery is so beautiful!! I just wish the story was a little bit better. Less depressing....I should add for those that are wondering... yes, just like the other reviews have mentioned, this is not a family show or kid friendly. There is violence, murders, nudity/SC, tons of swearing, and alcohol use. Also, I agree with the complaints about the sound being off.

There is always a tension in the air, no matter in which episode. There is a smoldering embers, a conflict that makes you bite your fingernails. When the episode is over, you go to bed unsatisfied, because it is so exciting that you want to continue watching immediately. This series is serious and funny at the same time, always in perfect balance.You don't have to be a Western fan to watch it, to love it, because it's not about Western themes.The Dutton family simply has what it takes. They take things into their own hands and don't let anyone intimidate them. Even if they sometimes proceed very brutally, as a viewer you are always on the side of the protagonists, because this family demands respect from you through their rough life and their life achievements over generations.Kevin Costner plays like in his prime - he's not dancing with the wolves anymore, he's a wolve himself now - and also the rest of the crew is killing it.What else can I say:Beth is a monster, a tornado. Kelly Reilly deserves an Emmy for her incredible performance as Beth Dutton. What a woman. Powerful, expressive, passionate, quick-tempered and aggressive, yet sensitive, vulnerable and empathetic. Her character is already a legend in pop culture. People sell t-shirts on the internet with the best comments of her.

I also like the many push-pull dynamics between family, the modern world versus the traditional ranching life, and overall the many different worlds and viewpoints that intersect in the show. I particularly like that there are dark/intense moments, but they are well balanced with the feel-good payoff moments. Hope they continue in that direction. So many shows start with great, multi-layered characters and storylines that inspire empathy but then spiral down into darkness, the show eventually turning the characters into people so unredeemable you no longer care about them (Sons of Anarchy, anyone?). And I love Rip!The only real criticism I have is they say the ""f"" word so much it gets ridiculous and feels contrived. If it's natural to the person or setting, it makes sense. If it's thrown in there just to up the Mature rating, it becomes jarring. I'm not opposed to profanity - it just has to fit the characters, and pretty much every character in the show, from every walk of life, seems to use it every other sentence (I'm expecting Tate to start spouting it any day now, lol). It doesn't fit.

tt4236770,ur73570919,7,16 March 2021,"A lot of reviewers come in trying to explain to readers how what they watched wasn't what they wanted it to be, instead of evaluating what it is. There's a lot of that on this one.Complaints about sex and violence I hope fall on deaf ears, as we were all witness to the global phenomenon that was GoT (this ain't the 1950's and it's never going to be again). Speaking of Game, I think it's much more accurate comparison to Yellowstone than Sopranos or the rest. Sadly, it falls short on the storytelling side in only using one mechanism to develop the main characters: external conflict. There is no natural or organic character development outside of the sometimes violent, sometimes tragic confrontations with the Dutton family, and it gets stale by Season 3 having to wait out standstills of progression for the next attack.Still, I stuck around for the finale, where in typical modern fashion they leave you on a brutal cliffhanger. Again, a bit of disappointment in the scale of the conflict being so thinly tied to anything realistic it's virtually impossible. That's where this show really falls flat on it's face - they had to opportunity to do so many things right (even in the confines of their current script) but just didn't. And for no good reason.Horses were wrong, which was strange as the writer/director is a horse owner. Gunfights were wrong. Cattle birthing was wrong. Fencing was wrong. Firing a magnum revolver in car with all of the windows closed with blow out your eardrums as well as all of the glass. Worst of all, casting was wrong. All white-knighting aside, hiring an Asian-American to play a native in a show that's already casting tribal issues in a nearly one dimensional light is just poor judgement.With all of that aside, the acting is there, as well as the investment and attachment to the characters (if you give them time to develop). The show is as much of a Western as TNG was a Sci-Fi about space exploration: about 20%. It's a drama and a soap with the backdrop of a Montana ranching empire that occasionally and unabashedly abandons realism for plot, and established personalities for thrills.All in all, it's an entertaining show that outshines most others in terms of production and acting quality, which is something we really need right now in TV.",0,1,/user/ur73570919/?ref_=tt_urv

Lastly, can someone be hired to teach them about cattle and horses since these play a big role in the show???? A new born calf jumping up and running away....really???? Tying a wild stallion in a trailer and then backing him out....hahahaha. Come on people, surely someone knows something about horses and cattle in the film industry.

Untrained horses go up not down, forward not back, backing out of a trailer takes time with a domestic horse. Loading in a horse trailer the first time can take hours! The calf running away right after birth got me too. As far as the horse goes, Quarter horse but could pass for a Kiger Mustang. Not trying to nit pick here, agree with what others have said. I just want to enjoy but am not clicking with any of the characters yet other than the son living on the Rez who caught the mustang. I like him and his wife & son. I have always liked Costner. I just like something down to earth western and this feels more like Dallas, which I was never a fan of. I know there are rich ranchers but I believe there are a lot out there like the Bundy's & the Hammonds and pics I've seen of their places look down to earth rancher rather than millions into a house. Rather than a housing development, I expected more what has happened with those families. Generations of ranching families putting blood sweat & tears into the land & leases where they improve water etc . . . only to have the government and BLM try to push them out like so many ranching families have been pushed out. I expected a love of the land/cattle & ranch like LaVoy Finicum which Costner could certainly pull off, so many people think ranchers are rich selfish whiners and that just does not cut it for me.

The backing out a wild stallion from a trailer( um .... curious how one guy got him in!), pulling a breach birth calf then see it scamper away (insulting to ranchers, everywhere!) trout fishing on horseback!

This character is undeniably a ruffian and a man's man that won't take any bull; but, there is that love for his land and heritage with an undercurrent of familial love that makes him compelling. The entire cast on this show has done a good job of portraying a family that has suffered tragedy and doesn't completely understand what it is their father is trying to accomplish. The patriarch is hard-nosed and expects unwavering loyalty and unquestioned obedience. In fact, all of the ""power people"" in this show have an agenda that I could be sympathetic to but they have ulterior motives that are definitely not admirable. Some the ranch hands are more loyal to the patriarch than the offspring, probably because of the ""second chance"" they've been given rather than being born to the life. All in all, this series has drama, intrigue, and suspense with some heart-touching emotions blended in.

The movie tries to incorporate as many references to the games as it can, while covering as much ground as it can. Some might even say it takes on too much ... I am not one of those people. Some may be dissapointed, because they expected something ... that was sort of a copy of the games - which would not make much sense in my book to be honest.Or you may not like the casting. Holland aside, it is Wahlberg who seems missplaced as Sully. I reckon since he was considered for the Nathan Drake part (which I guess tells you how long this must have been in development, no offense), they thought ""well at least he can play this mentor role"".Well Mentor may be stretching it a bit .. but you get where I am going with this. Drakes and Sullys relationship is explored or rather established in a different light and tone ... which you'll either find fine or disturbing I guess. Also Holland still seems so incredibly young you may feel he's too young ... again, you have to get over certain things.There's enough entertainment and action in this to keep you on the edge of your seat. Solid stunts and digital effects work. Not all twists work, but even the weird choice for Wahlberg as Sully actually can work for the viewer (again: suspension of disbelief) ... one thing is for sure: the chemistry between the two leads is incredible!

tt1464335,ur4248714,5,23 February 2022,"I didn't know in advance that this film was based on a popular video game series, but it kind of made sense, with the trailer filled with over-the-top moments, and I was up for a movie involving treasure hunting, directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad, Venom). Basically, young Nathan ""Nate"" Drake (Tiernan Jones) and his brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) are caught in a museum by security trying to steal the first world map made after the Magellan expedition. The brothers live in an orphanage, but Sam is on his third strike, and he will be forced to stay elsewhere, away from Nate. Returning to their room, Nate catches Sam sneaking out the window, but he promises his little brother that he will return for him. Sam leaves him with a ring belonging to their ancestor Sir Francis Drake, with the inscription ""Sic Parvis Magna"" (""Greatness from small beginnings""). Fifteen years later, Nate (Tom Holland) works as a bartender in New York City and pickpockets wealthy patrons. Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) introduces himself to Nate, he is seasoned treasure hunter who worked with Sam, and they tried to track down the treasure hidden by the Magellan crew. He explains that Sam disappeared after helping him steal Juan Sebastian Elcano's diary. Nate, who has several postcards Sam sent him over the years, agrees to help Sully to find his brother. Sully and Nathan go to an auction to steal a golden cross linked to the Magellan crew. There they encounter Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), the last descendant of the Moncada family who funded the original expedition, and Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), leader of mercenaries hired by Moncada. Nate is ambushed by Braddock's men, and the ensuing fight creates a distraction for Sully to disguise himself as an auction attendant to steal the cross. The treasure is supposedly hidden in Barcelona, so Nate and Sully travel there to meet Sully's contact Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), who has another cross. Chloe steals the first cross from Nate, and he chases her across town, until she is convinced to work alongside them. Meanwhile, Moncada confronts his father, Armando (Manuel de Blas), after learning that the fortune will be donated. Armando does not see his son being worthy of inheriting it, so Moncada orders Braddock to kill his father. Nate, Chloe, and Sully follow clues in Elcano's diary to Santa Maria del Pi, finding a secret crypt behind the altar of a church. Nate and Chloe enter the crypt, finding a trap door, but as they open it, the crypt floods with water. Sully tracks their movements above ground and barely manages to save them from drowning, whilst being pursued by Braddock. Nate and Chloe connect the two crosses to create a key to unlock a secret passage and find a map that indicates the treasure is in the Philippines. It turns out that Chloe was originally hired by Moncada, she betrays Nate and takes the map. Sully reunites with Nate and says after he and Sam recovered Elcano's diary, they were ambushed by Braddock. Nate is angered to learn, being caught in this situation, Sully narrowly escaped, while Sam was apparently shot dead. Moncada, Chloe, and Braddock's team depart in a cargo plane to find the treasure, but Braddock betrays Moncada and kills him. Nate and Sully managed to sneak aboard the plane and are hiding. Nate confronts Braddock for shooting her brother, while Sully parachutes out. Chloe tries to escape the aircraft with the map, reunited with Nate who is knocked out of the plane, and the two use a cargo container and its parachute to land on the water in the Philippines. But they realise that the map does not pinpoint the location of the treasure. Nate looks back on his postcards from Sam looking for any clues, and he finds the hidden, burning the back of it, and uses it to determine the coordinates to the treasure's location. Unsure of Chloe's loyalties, Nate leaves her fake coordinates, and reunites with Sully, only agreeing to find the treasure to finish what his brother started. Nate and Sully finds the two Magellan ships hidden in a cave, and both are filled with many hundreds of highly valuable golden pieces and objects. Braddock and her team track the ships down, forcing Nate and Sully to hide beneath deck as the crew airlift the ships from the caves. Nate and Sully return to deck, with Sully commandeering one of the helicopters, causing Braddock to order the other helicopter to crash into the other ship. Nate defends himself from her mercenaries and shoots down the other helicopter with one of the ship's cannons. Braddock drops that ship's anchor while Nate climbs to the helicopter. Sully throws a bag of collected treasure at Braddock, who is crushed to death when the ship breaks and falls. Naval ships approach the shipwrecks, meaning they are now property of the Philippines, while Nate and Sully escape in the helicopter. Nate makes a peace offering with Sully with a few pieces of pickpocketed treasure, while Chloe, in a speedboat below, is left empty handed. A mid-credits sequence reveals that Sam is still alive and writing his next postcard to Nate, while Nate and Sully get caught in a sticky situation on their next treasure hunt. Also starring Steven Waddington as The Scotsman, Alana Boden as Zoe, and Pingi Moli as Hugo. Holland is likeable as the streetwise young man, Wahlberg is alright as the professional fortune seeker, Ali is fine, and Banderas is underused as a villain, while Gabrielle is good being nasty. The treasure hunt story does feel like a copycat of Indiana Jones or The Goonies, so it is predictable, but the two leads, and the chases, boobytraps, stunts and thrills are enough to keep you hooked, a reasonable action-adventure.

So I sort of knew what I was in for here, as I sat down to watch the 2022 movie ""Uncharted"" from writers Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, Amy Hennig, Jon Hanley Rosenberg, Matt Holloway and Mark D. Walker.And just as expected, then director Ruben Fleischer definitely delivered a wholesome and spot on action adventure that delivers a fast-paced adventure that will make the boy-that-never-wants-to-grow-up-in-us-all more than happy. The storyline in ""Uncharted"" was a great mixture of fast-paced action, great adventure much in the likes of ""Indiana Jones"", treasure hunting and good characters. So yeah, chances are great that there is something for just about everyone in the audience here.The movie stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, whom actually carries the movie quite well together. But the movie also have the likes of Antonio Banderas, Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle and Steven Waddington on the cast list.I was more than genuinely entertained by this action adventure, and it certainly is a franchise that could spawn more movies to sequel this one. I had heard some reviewer mention that ""Uncharted"" was just a popcorn munchin movie that required no thinking of any kind. But I found ""Uncharted"" to be more than just a lean-back-and-munch-on-the-popcorn type of movie, luckily. If you enjoyed the ""Indiana Jones"" movies, then you will certainly also enjoy ""Uncharted"".As for realism, well just neatly wrap that notion in a small wrapping and place it on the shelf for the nearly two hours that ""Uncharted"" plays.

Almost like it's a ""factory-made"" movie rather than something hand-crafted.I didn't care about the characters. There are lots of stupid moments and things that make you raise an eyebrow. The treasure hunting stuff feels so random like they are making it up on the spot. The comedy isn't terrible, it made me smirk a bunch of times. But I don't think I laughed one single time. And a few of the jokes are super cringe-y.The action is alright. I like crazy, outrageous action movies. But none of scenes impressed me. I think part of it is not caring about the characters, which drains the tension. And the fight scenes are once again, for the millionth time, filled with quick-cuts and close-ups so you can't see. When will they learn?I really wish movies would go for the R rating more often. But if you're going to go with PG-13, please stop trying to show (but not show) things that should be in a rated R movie. For example, if someone's throat is slit, don't blatantly cut away at the last second. And then continue to show that person multiple times, with ZERO blood coming out. It makes the movie feel amateur.On four occasions I thought to myself, ""Look, Tom Holland is Spider-Man-ing."" And it's not because I can't see the actor in any other role. He is very different in Cherry. But things he said sounded exactly like something Peter Parker would say, and things he did looked exactly like Spider-Man would do them.

tt1464335,ur8462477,5,20 February 2022,"Going through a far more arduous process than many feature films would come close to experiencing when it comes to simply seeing the light of day, with news of an Uncharted movie being bandied about all the way back in 2008 with announcements following in 2010 that director David O. Russell would be the man in charge of the film as it stood those many moons ago, the first feature of the newly minted Sony Playstation Productions is thankfully more entertaining than most video game adaptations but in the harsh reality of the real world, that's not much of an achievement.Full of life, spectacle, lovable characters and more than its fair share of Indiana Jones DNA, Sony's incredibly popular Uncharted video game series is a deservedly praised property that many were excited to see be turned into a real life living and breathing entity but while director for hire Ruben Fleischer nails a few set pieces and continues on the type of form he showed with the second Zombieland and the first Venom (with his 2009 Zombieland debut feature feeling more and more like a fluke occurrence), there's a blandness too Uncharted that is unavoidable, as the low hanging fruit it clearly was attempting to reach sits firmly in its grasp.Following the treasure hunting exploits of new partners in crime, Tom Holland's daring Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg's long time swindler Victor Sullivan, as the two miss-matched operators attempt a globe spanning hunt of Ferdinand Magellan lost fortune that also is being hunted down by Sophia Ali's Chloe Frazer and Antonio Banderas's villain by the numbers Santiago Moncada, Uncharted is absolutely Indiana Jones lite, just without the winning jokes, the constant inventiveness and the wholly engaging characters.Getting started with a fairly eye-popping set piece that quickly gives way to an extended predominantly pedestrian formula of Drake and Sullivan getting to know each other while tracking down the next clue to their golden dreams, Uncharted struggles to do much of note for a significant amount of time with the film and us an audience awaiting something or someone to awake the films sleepwalking feeling that only really ever comes far too late in the equation when flying pirate ships and daring plane escapes take hold.Showcasing that Fleischer does know his way around an action set piece and a comedic set-up and that his tried and true performers have engaged and entertained audiences around the world countless times before, there's stages late in the piece here where Uncharted shows a little more energy and showmanship giving it more winning moments than your average video game adaptation but it's not enough to save the film entirely from its monotonous moments and uninspiring chemistry from its two main leads.Involved in the project for better part of a decade, Wahlberg was always a somewhat controversial choice as Sullivan and he does nothing to try and elevate himself from his recent funk of paycheck collecting performances and can't do enough to make us think we're watching anyone but Marky Mark while the so hot right now Holland commits himself physically as Drake, his turn also isn't worth celebrating with the two well-liked actors unable to generate much spark together let alone individually, a problem the film was never going to overcome no matter how much else it may've gotten right.Final Say -There is fun to be had from Uncharted but most of the good times start rolling in a little too late to save the day, with it's off the boil leads and by the numbers storytelling, this latest video game come to life blockbuster may not be sunken treasure but its unable to provide a reason to get excited about another hunt anytime soon.2 1/2 Naughty Dog stickers out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur8462477/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur50463365,6,17 February 2022,"Uncharted (2022) :
Movie Review -Every action-adventure film is supposed to remind you of Indiana Jones, even though it has different features and set-up. One has to admit that even our old lad Indian Jones has lost a lot of ground and charm with the last film because it couldn't immerse those old adventures in modern day theories. We don't even have many great swashbuckling flicks since we have been through with those classic pirate films of Errol Flynn and Johnny Depp. What if a video game adaptation is trying to mix these two adventurous theories together? That's how Uncharted feels most of the time. Although it goes over the top sometimes, it still has that larger-than-life vision to make a fine and plausible excuse.What helps the most is its modern-day storytelling. Well, the video game itself isn't too old, so it was obvious, but there is a balanced mixture of many theories and adventurous elements. It's not like we haven't seen them before, but they will remind you of several films. Remember that ""believe"" segment from Disney's recent flick 'The Raya And The Last Dragon'? It's there too. And then there's every known theory of treasure hunting, sacrifice, lost relatives, and betrayal.The film is about the greatest treasure hunt that was never found. 'Lost' he says, not gone. After a small flashback scene, Uncharted begins with a street-smart thief, Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), who is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to recover a fortune lost by Ferdinand Magellan 500 years ago, in the very first official meeting. What starts as a heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the clues and solve one of the world's oldest mysteries, they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nate's long-lost brother, but only if they can learn to trust each other, which is not easy. One is naive, while the other is a crook, and you know how it goes with them. The duo steal a golden cross, a key to some mysterious lock, and then they travel to Barcelona, where the treasure is supposedly hidden, to get Sully's contact Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) to join them as she has the second key. The trio explores a lot of secrets from the past and learns the true colours of the betraying ones during this gold hunt. What kinds of adventures and risks await them is all you get to see in Uncharted.Uncharted has got a tight screenplay right from the first scene, and it wraps up all the adventures quickly in less than two hours. Now, that's indeed very quick. It's a regular action film but has got some huge action sequences to entertain the action lovers. Even the opening scene is damn good, and it kind of gives you an idea that you are in for a large-scale action ride. The visuals also help in making it appalling. Not to mention the high-rage cinematography, especially in those flying scenes. That's where you have to keep your brain aside because it's not created to have any logic, it's generated with only one motive, and that's entertainment! Watch out for those high-octane action sequences in the pre-climax and climax portions. The former takes you high in the air, which is close to the stratosphere, I guess, while the latter takes you into the middle of air and water.The performances of Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are surely going to please their fans. In particular, Tom Holland. This guy is at the peak of his popularity with Spider-Man: No Way Home, and now he's got another super show for his fans. He is so good with his hand movements, expressions, and humour. That emotional scene when he remembers his brother shows his hidden talent. Mark Wahlberg gives kind of bossy vibes, but it's his cool attitude that makes it convincing. Antonio Banderas as a ruthless antagonist is fine on her part, whereas Sophia Ali somehow passes through. The support from Rudy Pankow and Tati Gabrielle is fairly decent.As for the faults, I must say, Uncharted isn't a critic-proof film. The cringed material with over-the-board, unimaginable, and humanly impossible actions does great harm to the logistics. I mean, you can't ask for the logic when you see a guy and a girl falling down from thousands of feet high and yet finding the balance right there in the air. However, it's up to your individual choice. Don't we see the same out of this world action in Marvel's superhero flicks? What's wrong with a video game film then? Yes, we had ""Jumanji"" in the 90s and the two modern versions in the last decade as our favourites, and Uncharted is somewhat comparable to that.Directed by Ruben Fleischer, the film is highly entertaining for video game fans, but wait, conditions apply. Please don't go out with big loads of expectations just because you have seen Spider-Man: No Way Home right after the reopening of cinemas and you can't wait to see Tom Holland in action again. There are some limits to human characters, so just don't expect superhero stuff, but do expect a lot of action. Director Ruben Fleischer ensures that every Tom Holland, Mark Walhberg, and Uncharted Game fan has a pleasurable theatre experience. Uncharted has almost struck gold, with some struggle, of course, and this treasure-hunt is worth looking at, if you aren't looking for a brain-storming film. It has everything that you would expect from a regular popcorn entertainer. Just don't forget to buy a big family pack with coke.RATING - 6/10*",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur50463365/?ref_=tt_urv

I'm not familiar with the games myself but the two main characters are played by Tom as Nathan Drake and Mark as Victor 'Sully' Sullivan. Mark recruits Tom in his search for 500 year old treasure that was lost on two ships of Ferdinand Magellan. In their search, they encounter Sophia and Tati-one a friend and one a foe-and Antonio, who thinks that he is entitled to the treasure because of his family lineage. There are lots of action and chase sequences and the plot reminds me of what it would be like if Indiana Jones went on a National Treasure hunt. One of the best stunts involves Tom falling out of an airplane and I heard that Tom said it was more difficult than his Spider_Man stunts. FYI: For those that are familiar with the game; there is a scene when Tom and Mark come out of the ocean and talk to a stranger lounging on the beach. That man-Nolan North-does the voice of Nathan Drake in the video games. There is a scene during the end credits that sets the stage for a sequel but nothing at the very end.It's rated PG-13 for violence, action and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",22,39,/user/ur2929860/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur8062935,2,28 February 2022,"And the 'we don't have a clue how to translate video games into movies' train departs w/Sony's belated adaptation of the popular videogame series. Never having played the games (even though I own them, something to do during my retirement years I figure!) but having seen footage & knowing the fanbase was lobbying for Nathan Fillion (of Firefly fame) to be cast as Nathan Drake, we now have our favorite current webslinger, Tom Holland, playing a younger version of him who is seduced by a worldly fortune hunter, played by Mark Wahlberg (who ironically was slated to play Drake when his go to guy David O. Russell was attached to the project) who go after some famed treasure whose clues (similar to clues seen in The DaVinci Code or National Treasure which beg the viewer's credulity in the over-complicated breadcrumbs left behind by the treasure hoarders) lead to hidden gold w/the requisite mustache twirling baddie, here played by Oscar nominee Antonio Banderas & his henchperson (who was once Wahlberg's protégé/partner), played by the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's Tati Gabrielle foiling Holland/Wahlberg's plans at every turn. Another partner, played by Sophia Ali, is in the mix as well but her distrust of her partners (something that after a while starts to grate on the viewer, if you don't trust them...leave!) soon upsets the flow of things. W/an overall sense of wrong people, wrong story permeating my feelings on the film, I soon tuned out & waited for the theater's house lights to dim up. Look for Rudy Pankow, from Netflix's Outer Banks, playing a younger version of Holland's brother & Stephen Waddington (Madeline Stowe's love interest in The Last of the Mohicans) playing Gabrielle's Scottish right hand man.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur8062935/?ref_=tt_urv

Though based on a much-loved video game series, the distinctive elements of the franchise's characters and stories have been dropped in favor of flat characterizations, bloodless violence, and an anemic screenplay that never strays from the shallowest understanding of the Hero's Journey. That being said, I didn't hate it: Tom Holland is charming in the lead and the story doesn't outstay its welcome with a 2+ hour runtime.

tt1464335,ur25226117,7,19 February 2022,"LIKES:The Pace:
It seems to be my starter, but the pace is exactly what one would want in an action/adventure movie. Like National Treasure, our ""heroes"" move through each of the locations in a rapid-fire motion, trying to race the clock and the bad guys to the clues in hopes of obtaining the prize. It balances touching moments with the high-speed thrills of the action and keeps you entertained for much of the movie.The Puzzles:
Puzzles are a staple of the Uncharted franchise, alongside the traps that litter them to bar entrance to the vault. While maybe not as intricate, layered, or maybe as deadly and pressing, this film has designed some fun clues and tests for Nathan and his ""squad"" to figure out that are adventurous and fun. Like Indiana Jones with a modern skin, the movie does a fine job of bringing the fun of the games with the cleverness of the traps, and keeping in time to the pace of the movie and the general audience rating.The Music/Sound Editing:
A minor like for some, the music of the movie is something like Pirates of the Caribbean, where it adds that spirt of adventure and excitement in the background. Uncharted has two types of music to set the mood, the orchestral pieces being the primary one that take both mood and amplitude and fill the speakers with that spirit of adventure as we dove into the quests at hand. Meanwhile, the quieter moments and a certain select scenes, jump into the modern-day element and spice up the mood with some toe tapping, upbeat, techno songs or maybe a little smoother jazz to mix things up, or go towards the sentiment. Great works in the sound department, Hollywood's arsenal of sound effects is set to bring all the action to life. Sprung traps, breaking bones, powerful booms, and weapon unloading, all have that added emphasis, once more pulling you more into the moment and feeling you are in the moment with them, well as much as you can be given the limited experience.The Story:
It's not the most complicated, and it's not the most extensive, but for an adaptation of a video game... it again works. Uncharted took the highlights of a game's story, mixed a little more of the character moments, brought the treasure hunts in, and led to the adventure at hand. All those things added up together quite well and brought a complete tale into a two-hour run time, which is always the challenge. This should be good for the general audience, while also nodding to the nostalgia factor of the games baked in. Thus, the story is decent for a summary movie.The Action:
Again, the video game makes it more involved and complex, with plenty of moments to immerse and blow our minds with traps and stunts. This movie did okay mirroring it, bringing the elements of chase moments, parkour, gun play, and close combat fighting that held enough elements to be fun and worthy of the theater. The stunts are adequate to be performed in real life, they have some personality to them, and still hold the fast pace you expect in the adventure element of the movie. As such, the versatility and creativity are very Drake like to me, never getting too out there, but still holding ground to the versatility and improvisation that the treasure hunter is. Again, not the worst transition to the big screen and quite enjoyable.The Acting:
Casting the legendary roles of game characters becomes increasingly challenging in the modern era given the struggles of fandom vs. The art of the movie director. While not an exact match on a lot of levels, my time with the Uncharted series found these guys to be fitting fill ins for the character in terms of personality. Holland as Drake hits more of the flashy, main lead with issues role well, taking the chip on his shoulder and funneling it into the adventurous wonder and thief we know Drake to be. True, he is a little young acting compared to the design of the lead, but he makes up for it with the sarcasm and attitude he develops as the movie continues on. Wahlberg is well... Wahlberg, and by this point you either love his brand of line delivery, or you hate it. For me, the Ted like delivery of lines, minus most of the heavy language, alongside his timing with the dialogue works for me and I enjoyed the chemistry he has with Holland as he gets the quest going. Banderas achieves his levels well as the antagonist, continuing to refine his leader of a big organization and improve on not being quite as overdone. He's got the voice down pretty well, his mannerisms match well, and his chemistry with the secondary and tertiary characters is again believable. Everyone else is fantastic too, the female leads hitting their roles super well and adding some much-needed flavor to mix things up and enjoy the comedy that they wrote in.DISLIKES:Predictable:
Whether you know the games, or you know the genre, the movie is not really that surprising or have any unexpected twists. The writing gives you all the big reveals to come, a bit too forced and emphasized, without using other tricks to throw you off the trail. Sure, the adventure element helps to keep these moments easier to handle, but there are still those moments from other movies that managed to throw that one punch that knocked you off your feet. So, if you are expecting a big twist or mind blown moment, dapper that down.A Bit Rushed in Character Moments:
Again, I have limited experience with this franchise, but my understanding is there are more connections and dives into the characters' psyche to paint them to new levels. However, this movie seemed to start scratching that itch, but not quite delivering on the full picture and could have hit a little more on some of the character. Holland's character they achieve well, but the rest of the group, has much more to learn, potentially leaving for the potential sequels they seem to be arranging. The promise is there, with just enough nods to make things work, but more is needed to really make the great characters I think they are looking for.Harder Puzzles/A few More Stakes:
Indiana Jones and other tomb raiding movements decorated the screens with those immense traps and some stakes to play the game by and get you deep into the sequence. While the traps were fine in this movie, Uncharted still needed more of the video game magic to trap the people in, and try to throw off the scent of the predictable story. Maybe a few extra characters, or taking the liberties to give some injury would probably have helped spice up the traps and puzzles a bit more to really give you that extra blow.Banderas Needing More Menacing:
He starts hitting the right notes, but Banderas needed a bit more time on the screen this time to really give the deadly finesse he was going for. As I stated earlier, he has smoothed out the rough edges, but there is still more to execute to really up his villain game, which means giving him more time. Maybe a little more gunplay, perhaps some strategy or solving skills of his own, or some other extra factor everyone else had to make him that villain belonging into this world. With a little more work, this role could have been quite the stab into the adventures of Drake.The Suspense of Disbelief:
My friend that accompanied me on this film stated it great, a little disbelief is fun, but too much leads to eye rolling moments that make the scenes a bit cheesier than grand. Uncharted really does this in this movie, with logic and rationale going out the window as they discover the chambers to find the ultimate prize. Riggings that survived nearly a millennium of docility, random room that were undiscovered despite the proximity to civilian centers, or how about the lack of damage from these traps are just some of the things that are a little too hyperbolic. Several other decisions they made are humorous or make for great spectacle, but you can't help but groan at times at how stretched they are. Fortunately, that adventure spirit is still there and again mitigates the cheese factor to still be fun and enjoyable, while fitting into the flow of the movie.The VERDICT:Uncharted may not be the best movie to come on the silver screen or the best adaptation of a game, but it's also not the stinkers other video game films have hit in the past. This version is fun, feeling very much like an adventure movie that has the spirit of fun and big thrills that we've come to expect. Puzzles are fun, the characters have great openings, and the acting makes for just a very entertaining spectacle that should be welcomed by many of the general audience. This is not a movie to hate, and it really does have the elements of the game that made that series fun, though I admit to far less details than the game. This tale does not hit the character feels to the full extent, it needs hard puzzles and some liberties to be taken to help throw the twists, and there are very bad stretches that while fun, can leave you huffing at how ridiculous they are. Yet, my buddy and I both really enjoyed the film and found it worthy of a theater visit, primarily for the spectacle of the scenes.My scores for this film are:Action/Adventure: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur1257208,10,19 February 2022,"I like Uncharted because it is based on the 2007 PlayStation video game of the same name. You never know who to trust in this action-packed, two-hour treasure hunt game turned movie.Uncharted is about the adventures of treasure hunter and fortune seeker Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) as he discovers the truth behind a mythical treasure during his journey with Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg). Nathan and his brother grew up in an orphanage until one day they got caught stealing a map. Nate's brother runs away. Sometime later Nate meets Sully who convinces Nathan to look for the lost treasure. Nathan and Sully team up to get the keys that open doors and traps in order to find more clues. Nate follows what his brother and him wanted to do ever since they were younger and that's when the action begins.This film has extraordinary computer-generated imagery effects. The explosion scenes look real. The cargo airplane scene is one of the most breathtaking and intense scenes of this film, keeping the audience at the edge of their seat. The actors' wardrobe is the same wardrobe as the characters in the video game: typical explorer or hunter's clothes and gear. Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland work masterfully well together while Antonio Banderas as villain Santiago Moncad will stop at nothing to get what he wants, including killing his own father. You don't have to be a video game fan to enjoy this treasure-hunting movie. Director Ruben Fleischer expressed that Tom Holland, as the younger version of the video character Nathan Drake, is a key to making a movie adaptation that offers something for gamers and newcomers alike. My favorite scene is when Nate gets hit by a car when he finally gets to the cargo plane.The moral of this film is to be very careful who you trust. Don't trust anyone, only yourself and your instincts. The audience will confirm my statement when watching the movie: Every character pursues same goal-the mystical treasure-and they will do anything and everything in order to get it, even if that means they have to kill.I give Uncharted 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

tt1464335,ur23240045,6,18 February 2022,"The Uncharted video game franchise is my favourite series of games ever made. I thought I should get that out of the way before diving into my review. Upon the countless storylines I'm sure they went over and numerous directors leaving the project before settling on Ruben Fleischer, I was worried, but still very excited to see these characters on the big screen. This will also be a completely unbiased review because I can't even compare it to the games. Too many things have been changed to really compare it. With all of that said, let's dive in.The story begins with young Nathan Drake, a bartender who had one day planned on finding treasure with his brother Sam. After the disappearance of his brother, he never felt the need to get back into the game. When Victor Sullivan (Sully) appears after his shift one night, he brings up the past, saying that he worked with his brother Sam. This instantly makes Nathan want to be a part of this story and the two of them form a bond. These two believe that a fortune left behind by Ferdinand Magellan over 500 years ago is still sitting somewhere in the world. They take this journey together, but they're not the only ones after this treasure, which leads to a lot of predictability as well.When I first heard that Tom Holland was cast to play Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg would be playing Sully, I, like many other fans, was left scratching my head. It was clear that they wanted to start these characters younger than they were in the game in order to build a long-running franchise, but it just didn't seem right. Again, I'm wasn't about to let my love of the games sway me in any direction though. I'm a huge fan of both Holland and Wahlberg, so here's the catch-22 happening in my head. Did I enjoy this movie overall and did I enjoy these two in their respective roles? I absolutely did! Do I still feel that it was a little miscast and that they should've been older? I absolutely do! For both of those reasons and for a few negatives I'm about to get into, I believe Uncharted is an okay, entertaining movie for the most part.Ruben Fleischer has been a very hit-or-miss director for me, directing both Zombieland films, which I think are great, as well as Venom, which I had some fun with, but he has also done some pretty bad films in Gangster Squad and 30 Minutes or Less. His films always have a very clean look to them and a silly/fun tone. I was worried that tone wouldn't fit an Uncharted movie and I do feel that way after having seen the film as well. Bright and colourful (other than landscapes around them) is not how I ever saw an Uncharted movie looking, but again, it was adapted and I'm not going to complain about the look. What I feel is the weakest aspect of this film is the fact that there's absolutely no grit. Nobody is ever dirty, there's barely any blood, and it never feels like stakes are high because these characters can go through a lot without a scratch.Overall, I probably have more to critique than praise when talking about Uncharted, but that's just because the Screenplay felt like it was hitting random bullet points instead of fleshing out the world they're living in. It never felt lived-in. Still, I love the cast (including Antonio Banderas and Sophia Ali as well), the banter between Nathan and Sully was fun, the action is cool, and I left the theatre feeling positive enough about the film that I would love to see them continue. I will gladly go back for a sequel, but I just hope they evolve these characters more and get down to a grittier, dirtier story. Yes, the point of Uncharted is to have fun and tell a great story, but I felt the story was a little hollow here. I think it's a movie worth seeing and I recommend it because I think there is potential for so much better in the future.

The puzzles were nice, most of the jokes land (at least, until half of the film...after that, too repetitive) and it was super fast paced (probably too much).I just feel that the film is not sure about what it wants to be.

tt1464335,ur147091341,5,14 February 2022,"After many years we finally have an Uncharted film, this film is based on the really popular video game franchise and today I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man getting recruited to go on a hunt for a long lost treasure.Main Character
Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake and I can't help myself he is really entertaining to watch and I think this is just because of Holland's natural charm and charisma manages to drag him through. But the issue is that he just isn't what I wanted from Nathan Drake as a character, he is nothing like his video game counterpart and that is a big shame. I was watching the film and all I saw was Peter Parker just without his Spider-Man costume. Hopefully, this is only because this film came out just after Spider-Man: No Way Home but I do worry that Holland might become typecast and a one trick pony.Supporting Characters
Mark Wahlberg plays Sully and it is a similar story to our main character. He has plenty of natural charisma to him and his chemistry with Holland is really good and at least there is some sort of character development on show. But I felt like it was Mark Wahlberg walking around and the character of Sully from the video games and that was the issue for me, he is just the same as he is in every other film and this is a slight shame for me. Sophia Ali plays Chloe and I actually quite liked her, maybe because she was the one performer I didn't recognise made her feel like an actual character and somebody who was actually interesting to watch. The bad guys didn't work though, Antonio Banderas is here but he is just your generic villain and I don't know when but it seems like when a European bad guy is needed then he is the one cast and it just didn't work here. Tai Gabrielle is better as a villain but she isn't that great either but was at least a physical enemy to Drake.Story
The story did a pretty good job of showing a young Nathan Drake starting his career and leading us on a fun adventure story across the globe that had shades of Indiana Jones to it. There is some sort of character development attempted and the actors seemed like they were having fun here. But there is a lack of depth and direction for the overall plot of the film. I think it could needed to pace itself a bit better and focus on the characters a bit more and give the villains way better motivations.Script
The film actually has a surprising amount of humour to it and I was chuckling my way through most of the film, mixed with a bit of heart made this alright. But there isn't enough here, I didn't care about the characters enough and sometimes it felt like the film relied on its star power instead of actually crafting these better written heroes and villains.Style
The style has some really good action scenes, including the crazy cargo plane scene that was in all of the trailers. The film is quite relentless too, the adventure moves at a pretty break neck pace which is good but it also harms the characterisation and plot of the film. It was a fun action film without the depth needed to become a good film.Overall
Overall, Uncharted is a pretty average adventure film. There is some good here for sure and Sony are hoping to make this a franchise but it doesn't do enough for me to get me excited for that or recommend this for a watch.Rating - 5/10.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv

Yet despite treading this well worn path, Uncharted gets the execution right and manages to always be fun and entertaining.The action sequences are all exciting, with some nice call backs to the games in certain areas.It is paced very well coming in at under two hours, which is a real point in its favour as it never becomes over indulgent.Tom Holland is solid in his role as Nathan Drake, as is Mark Wahlberg as Sully.

A paint-by-numbers affair, but elevated slightly because it does try to inject charm.It's not a waste of time to view it, but you will be reminded of films that have gone over the same territory.I am convinced there will eventually will be a sub-category genre of ""treasure hunting"" films. ""Tomb Raider,"" ""National Treasure"" and the gold standard anything Indiana Jones falls under this category. And more will come. In this case, it is based on a Playstation video game. Much of which will be nudged and winked upon. And it isn't that they're are references to better movies in this sub-genre. They understand the ground in which they walk.To that, I give them credit for such an endeavor.In the grand scale of things, it is essentially an adult ""Goonies""
The search of pirate treasure. In this case, it's not One-Eyed Willie, but a more convoluted story of Magellan and his exploration of gold on behalf of a family that funded this expedition. But alas, the greedy monsters hid the gold and told his sponsors they saw nothing.As wild as ""National Treasure""'s Illuminati nonsense, this wants you to believe in fortune and glory (heh heh heh Temple Of Doom).Here Nathan Drake is played by Tom Holland. A bit too young for my taste, but made so for future installments. In the game (admittedly I am not an ""Uncharted"" entusiast) it felt that Nathan may have been a bit longer in the tooth. At an even younger age is influenced by his brother that things like this aren't lost. A wink to the fact that everything can be found. So if the gold exists this will be found. A nice little foreshadowing of the following adventure.A mysterious fortune hunter played by Mark Wahlberg recruits him to follow the clues and help in recovering billions in gold. The connection here is very mysterious and feels like a missing reel that would explain this connection. Much of which may be explored in future storylines (if there will be any). And so, the rest is written with the familiarity of every gold hunting flick.Again, it's not that it's terrible. It's a nice time waster. BUT, it treads on so many familiar tropes it's hard to fully give them credit for a carbon template of other such stories.I know a lot of people will connect Holland with the Spider-Man personae. I've not watch much of him in the Marvel universe, but here he just seems a little out of place. Supposedly a rugged guy, he seems more comfortable as a pre-teen. Perhaps they should've given him a few more years before he moved forward on this.The action itself is also a bit lackluster. Fight scenes appear choreographed and the end on the pirate ships seem so...well, animated. Oh, not to mention hurdling drop crates coming out the back of a cargo plane. Wow was that crazy (and very unbelievable, in a bad way)!All in all, this was obviously a launch point origin story of what is to come. If that is a possibility.

tt1464335,ur52993466,8,16 February 2022,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Street-smart thief Nathan Drake (played by Tom Holland) is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (played by Mark Wahlberg) to recover a fortune lost by Ferdinand Magellan 500 years ago. What starts as a heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Moncada (played by Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the clues and solve one of the world's oldest mysteries, they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nate's long-lost brother...but only if they can learn to work together.The fun adventure heist is based on the Playstation video game UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection - PlayStation 5. In fact, it's the first feature film by Sony Playstation Productions. I've never played the game myself and so I'm reviewing the movie as a stand-alone film. I had no expectations, but recognize that fans of the game most definitely will, so their reactions may be different from mine. Rumor has it that Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (PS4) is Tom Holland's favorite game in the series.THINGS I LIKED:
I love both Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, so I got a kick out of seeing them together. They have good chemistry, which made for some entertaining banter about each other's ages, skillsets, and motivations.Antonio Banderas tested positive for Covid during filming and had to leave the production for a short time while he recovered. It's always good to see him.Great opening scene! Tom Holland said it was the hardest action sequence he has ever filmed.Plenty of adventures and clues to figure out on this treasure hunt. If you love puzzles, riddles, and deciphering ciphers, you'll enjoy this high-octane quest.There are also a lot of fun action sequences with impressive and creative stunts that made me laugh a few times.Good special effects and set designs.The movie ends with a taste of a sequel, something I'd like to see. Mark Wahlberg only signed a one-film contract, so hopefully, he'll change his mind if this first installment does well.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The villains are underdeveloped but they serve their purpose.It's extremely predictable, following all of the cliched tropes of this genre.The trailers got mixed reviews, just like the film itself so far.Video game movie adaptations are always a bit problematic because of the fans' expectations and the common lack of truly understanding the source material. I've heard some gamers explain that the story in the movie is a let-down from those who love the game.The set designs LOOK like set designs.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity
There are subtitles when Spanish is spoken.Several murders
This might spark some interest in the history of Magellan.Lots of violence

However, if you're a fan of the game and watching based off that then it's a bit clunky and miscasted.So why is it good? If this was just a bog standard action film and no relation to the game then it would be decent. The chemistry between Holland and Wahlberg was good, the little nuggets of humour I thought worked well within the plot and got a few giggles out of me and most importantly it's a really entertaining and fun film to watch.Any negatives? There's a few. Basing this of being an action/adventure film and nothing more. So the characters had this whole ""backstabbing"" trait, one would backstab the other two, little down the line it happens again and so on. First few times it's a nice twist that adds to the plot. But by the end I found it to be very saturated and annoying.I thought they could have done more with the depth of the characters as well. The first half an hour or so mostly. It sort of glossed over any of the depth, we found out Sully was dishonourably discharged, 2 lines at most about it and not mentioned again. This is a common theme, where a big part about the character comes up and it's quickly glossed over and not mentioned again. I heard this got rewrote a few times so I would assume that's got caught in the crossfire.Poor adaptation? I'd say so. I've played the Uncharted games and I enjoyed them. I think it was miscasted. Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg actually do really good jobs! But it just didn't feel right from an adaptation point of view. Behind that the plot just didn't feel like it fit, there was certain scenes added from the game definitely (plane for example), but that was kind of that. Random scenes thrown in to appease the game fans.This is why I believe if you're watching because you enjoy the game a lot. Then don't bother.

tt1464335,ur81040920,6,24 February 2022,"Gaming is something I have loved for years and the ""Uncharted"" franchise is something that I have always adored. I think it's one of the best franchises Naughty Dog has ever created and Nolan North did such a fantastic job voice acting the beloved Nathan Drake.Sony making a movie about ""Uncharted"" is not a bad idea in my opinion, though films based on a video game has never had a great outcome. Something in me though did feel hope: maybe this time it was going to be different and ""Uncharted"" is definitely one of the best ""based on a video game"" movies I have seen. It's not a great film, but is very fun indeed. Hardcore fans of the game franchise are going to be disappointed by the casting and the story, but regular moviegoers are going to enjoy this movie.Let's start with the good aspects, shall we?. The production values of the movie are great. Mostly everything looks and sounds good. It was nice to hear the ""Uncharted"" theme in a movie. The acting is not bad either. Tom Holland tries his best as Nathan Drake. He is definitely likeable in the role and he does most of his own stunts. Antonio Banderas has an interesting presence to him, but do not expect to see much of him. He is marketed as the main villain of the story... I hate to break it to you: he is not. The villain is more female than male... Mark Wahlberg isn't bad either as Sully, but the actor I was most impressed by was Sophia Ali, who I thought made a very good Chloe Frazer.. The story is mostly thrilling and fun. There is some good humor, intrigue to be found here. As said before, most people are going to have a semi-good time watching this film. Some of the action sequences are fine too. The one on the plain being the most white-knuckling.That being said, this movie is far from perfect.. The direction by Ruben Fleischer does not have that charisma or style like an ""Uncharted"" game had. The last action sequence for example has some very quick cut editing, which took the fun away from the sequence. I'm not saying the movie should be like the games, but it would have been nice if the direction would have added something to the scenery.. There are some serious problems with the script and character work in ""Uncharted"". Nathan Drake being the only one, who got a nice backstory. There is some iffy dialogue here and there and Mark Wahlberg is just not Sully, but an arrogant theif, which was a massive disappointment for me ( I really like Sullivan in the game. He is a like a father to Drake and always good with the ladies). People say that ""Uncharted"" is a prequel story so the change they did to Sully is not that bad. I strongly disagree. The ""Uncharted 3 and 4"" games had a lot more convincing backstory to Drake. So if the wanted to do a prequel story, they should have followed the blueprint so to speak.. The villains in ""Uncharted"" are quite weakish too. There are so many betrayals in this story, that you are beginning to question every single character (expect for Drake), so the main villain (Jo) does not come as a surprise at all.Overall, a fine movie time, but nothing great.6/10

But does that make this a bad movie? No, not really. I actually enjoyed most of this.This is not Indiana Jones, this is more Tales of the Gold Monkey if anyone remembers that. A bit of Gilligan island, and a hint of Lara Croft. But mostly, in production value and feel, it reminds me of The Librarian.The problem with this movie is that all of those shows and movies I mention are a lot better with better script, better characters and slightly more believable storytelling. The good thing about this movie is that Wahlberg and Holland and the movie itself have a decent time and drags you with it.

I don't know if this is good or bad, but it turns out a certain view from the outside.Nowadays, all films can be divided into three large groups: superhero movies (there are a lot of them, they are also extremely diverse in quality); faceless action movies whose plot cannot be remembered the next day after viewing; and serious movies that raise important social topics.So, ""Anchored: not on the cards"", fortunately, is not included in any of these groups. This is a cool adventure movie, which has not been on the big screens for so long (since the time of ""Treasures of the Nation"").Plot. As in any adventure movie, the whole plot is based on a treasure hunt. The film begins with a small flashback showing Nathan Drake's past, or rather his childhood. And then the main action does not take long to wait and immediately breaks into the cinema screens. Everything happens quickly, the plot moves without pauses or long dialogues that do not carry a plot load. This can also be considered a minus of the film: personally, I did not have enough time to get acquainted with the main characters outside the main plot, we were very quickly introduced to Nathan, Sally, and them among themselves. The main plot twists of the film are connected with the word ""betrayal"". I will say separately about humor - it is there, there is a lot of it and it does not look absurd or stupid, all jokes are quite appropriate.Setting. Here the authors of the film did a great job. During the film, we will visit several locations at once, which are shown in all their glory. For example, part of the action takes place in Barcelona, and if you have been there, you will easily find out the specific places where the heroes are.Action and stunts.

tt1464335,ur59184301,9,26 February 2022,"How is a movie based on a video game more soulless than the game itself? The knock against the world of gaming has long been that they lack a human element, but Ruben Fleischer's ""Uncharted"" feels emptier than the award-winning franchise on which it's based. Dominated by green screen special effects and thin treasure-hunt plotting, ""Uncharted"" fundamentally lacks the sense of adventure that turned the Sony games into some of the most beloved of all time. What's most startling is how much the games themselves feel more cinematic in terms of world building, character, and narrative than the actual movie. It's not quite as disastrous as some video game adaptations, and it's at least light enough on its feet to never insult the intelligence of its fan base as so many of these movies tend to do. Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) was conceived as a throwback to Indiana Jones and the serial adventure films that inspired him. He should be a smooth-talking treasure hunter, someone who exists in a slightly gray moral area wherein stealing priceless artifacts is warranted because no one else can really appreciate them like Drake. Holland has the agility but quite simply lacks the weight and world-weariness needed for a character like Drake, who was raised in an orphanage and is willing to steal to make ends meet. If Indiana was typically the smartest person in a room, Drake needs to be the one with the sharpest instincts, someone who sees the puzzles of history from a place of expertise and courage. Holland is a smart actor, but he's just wrong here, always looking a little bit like a kid dressing up as his favorite video game character. They quickly cross paths with Santiago Moncada (an Antonio Banderas so underutilized that one has to believe half his part was cut), the heir to the family that funded the original expedition. ""Uncharted"" checks boxes for fans and newbies but does so in such a predictable manner that it lacks any edge or spark.

That's what I got, that's all I really needed and I'm happy I saw it. If you're a fan like myself, I think it's important to go into Uncharted accepting that this is an alternate take with no bearing on the game's timeline. Also, be warned: This is an abundantly clichéd movie, I won't deny that. I'm sure it will drive most people nuts with the sea of overused adventure film tropes it swims through.With that said, I feel the filmmakers had the right idea about what Uncharted is about and that wins major points in my book. I can overlook the hackneyed structure if loyalty to the source material is strong, and it is. From the snarky one-liners, to the history babble and eye-catching action in absurd scenarios, Uncharted is a thoroughly entertaining, swashbuckling popcorn flick that pays homage to the groundbreaking PlayStation games by Naughty Dog. After all, the games themselves are odes to action blockbusters. It's pulpy, it's self aware, it's paced like the games and you know what: I had a good time.There wasn't a moment where I felt like the filmmakers were misguided. I mean, I could've used a lot more character depth, though. If the film lacks anything from the games, it's that. Nevertheless, I thought Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg breathed a fairly charming new life into Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan. Despite my initial concerns, nothing about their performances had me groaning at all. They held my attention and their chemistry hit the right notes more times than not. I had no problem believing they were Drake and Sully. I think faithfulness and believability is so crucial to the success of video game movies.

Globetrotting treasure hunts are exciting, the core cast is intriguing, and the budget was clearly decent. However, Uncharted lacks creative thought, so it's fundamentally average. First, the script is bare. The story is shallow, the characters are flat, and the surprises are underwhelming. Frequently, choices are contrived plot devices rather than authentic developments. Motivations are weak and character arcs are flimsy. Plus, the chemistry between Holland and Wahlberg is awkward. Holland is charming and Wahlberg likes his counterpart, but their styles of banter don't gel.Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Uncharted is too sterile for a rugged adventure. The effects are extensive but CGI heavy, defusing tension and engagement. Furthermore, the violence is excessively clean. Deaths are only implied and blood is minimal, contradicting the film's promise of excitement. This also applies to the production design, which is elaborate yet too polished to feel like a true journey. Beyond that, Uncharted is basic. The music, editing, sound, and cinematography are all competent but plain. The film just isn't elevated by its technicals.

And when there at risk it doesn't feel like it, as the characters don't have any sore parts of there body. And some things are unexplained. Yes They made this movie mostly to make profit from it, because Hollywood likes money, and merchandise. I understand why they put Tom Holland inside the film because he is a young actor, but he's not right for the role. Mark Wahlberg is way too young to be playing ( victor ). And the action and bad guys are also dull. And it copies heavily from other films. Tom Holland ( Nathan Drake ) and Mark Wahlberg ( Victor Sullivan ) have no real chemistry, some people say they are amateurs at times which I would agree.The good parts to this film is the humour that's well worked.

And the movie isn't all that bad to look at, and this movie does throw you CGI left right and centre but it does look stunning, and the effects do look like there actually from a video game, some would say that's awful effects and I do admit, but atleast this movie does look like the game in some way, which is the main thing.

This is not a hood reimagining.I like wahlberg he was fine, about the only character that worked except the female explorer. He over-shone Holland to the point it was pretty embarrassing for the guy.I thought I was a Holland fan but I've fast realised anything that isn't Spider-Man that he's done has been literally abysmal, that mute, dream power mess and various other awful messes he's been in, fast going off him, looks to young to be a believable badass or heart throb, has no presence, no authority and delivers the lines exactly like spider man, that cheeky, childish dialogue, pretty one dimensional. He is no leading man, awfully wrong for the role, see why you got him as he's popular but he just played it wrong and just looked like a child. Poor, it may have actually worked better swapping mark and Tom. Toms performance was pretty bad.There's just no action, boring story and set pieces from a video game, it's lazy, uneventful, woke weak nonsense, it's literally aimed at little kids, there's no actual adult action , the fight scenes are so basic and non violent.The effects were average, yeah looked nice but just didn't work for me, rest of the characters were meh, the tease with the guy from GOT, does nothing for me and the moustache line was awful.

Yes Mark Wahlberg didn't resemble sully that much, but he did his own thing and had good chemistry with Tom Holland. Speaking of which, his take on the character grew on me. While I could only see Peter Parker initially, it didn't take long until I could see him as the young Nathan Drake. All was going well until they killed off the best character in the movie just to ""subvert expectations"".Antonio Banderas' villain performance was everything I wanted from this type of movie. He was intimidating, badass, had clear if cliched motivations and fit the role of an uncharted villain perfectly. And yet, he was suddenly killed off before he could do anything useful. He barely even encountered Nathan Drake. What a disappointment. And the worst part was there was no one to fill his shoes. Tati gabrielle then filled the villain role. And wow. What a down grade in every way. She wasn't the least bit intimidating. She couldn't act as well or have anywhere near the same presence.The rest of the movie had good action but I was so distracted thinking why would they ever kill off such an affective villain.Just such wasted opportunity.",37,64,/user/ur64692948/?ref_=tt_urv

tt1464335,ur1210420,7,16 February 2022,"Has finally arrived on the big screen.The movie is based on the hit Playstation series of games by Naughty Dog and stars Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, a young man who is as adept at history as he is with pickpocketing which he uses to offset his income from Bartending.Nathan's brother fled the law years earlier and aside from Postcards has had no contact with him over the years. Things change when Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) arrives and recruits Nathan by showing him that he used to work with his brother. Despite misgivings and unresolved feelings; Nathan joins with Victor and finds himself in a daring caper to steal a valuable object that could unlock the key to a gold supply that has been lost for over five hundred years.Naturally, there are others who want the money, and Nathan, Victory, and their dubious partner Chloe (Sophia Ali); as they rush around the world in one adventure after another to solve the ancient puzzles and stay one step ahead of some very deadly individuals.The movie has elements of ""National Treasure"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in terms of the quests to find ancient treasures mixed with action but keeps things in a simpler context. The focus is not on plot development, character development, or plausibility but considering the film is based on a video game, it does a good job with the source material.There has been some controversy about the casting of Holland as Nathan is older in the game series, but he goes all-in with his performance even when the acrobatic action sequences does offer many reminders of his Spider-man role.The action in the game is fun and over-the-top and more than once I thought I should be pushing my X and Square button to help him make the moves necessary to complete the task and survive.The post-credit scenes offer some great possibilities for future adventures and those would be more than welcome for those looking for some no-brainer escapist entertainment.3.5 stars out of 5.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur1210420/?ref_=tt_urv

Although it's just a typical treasure hunting action film, it has its moments which were worth the money.Lots of flaws in the casting. First of all, Mark Wahlberg looks absolutely nothing like Sully. His acting was also nothing like Sully. Brad Pitt would have been a better choice in my opinion because of his looks.The next flaw is the casting for the character of Chloe Fraser. I don't remember Chloe being a brown girl in the game. So why the need for making her brown? Why couldn't the makers just cast a white British brunette for the role instead of casting a brown American girl to fake a British accent? Big mistake!Tom Holland although was able to look like Drake, couldn't portray him accurately. His character was shown to be effeminate and foolish which is completely opposite to Drake in the game. Seems like the writers couldn't tell the difference between someone who is witty with jokes and someone who is a simp by nature. Yes Drake cracks jokes throughout all the games but he maintains his masculinity which was absent in Tom Holland's Drake character.Next flaw is the character of Santiago Moncada played by Antonio Banderas. It seemed like a very promising character but it was totally ruined. Antonio Banderas was completely wasted in this movie and the makers couldn't make proper use of his talent.Overall the movie has its fun moments mainly during the action scenes but acting wise none of the actors were able to live up to the expectations.

tt1464335,ur84421527,4,28 February 2022,"As video games continue to rise in popular culture, it's only natural that they should receive more film adaptations. Uncharted, which is one of the most popular franchises under the PlayStation brand, is very cinematic in its own right. Inspired by adventure films like Indiana Jones, the games are practically interactive movies themselves. For this, the ideal is to make a movie that appeals both to general audiences and to fans of the series. Uncharted is a movie that succeeds to a certain extent to the former and fails tremendously in the latter. The movie throws the canon of the games out the window, although it does directly adapt some scenes from the games. It takes the auction house scene from Uncharted 4, the plane scene from Uncharted 3, the whole arc with Sam from 4.As an adventure movie, it's nothing special, but nothing too terrible. If you know nothing about the source material, you may even find yourself enjoying it. It's got some fun moments in it. It's got a heist at an auction house, ancient puzzles in a Gothic church, and plenty of action in the sky. Some of these action scenes really do capture the spirit of adventure movies, which is always great fun. While some of them are lifted right from the games, they do play out well for what they're worth. There are moments when the adventure spirit kicks in, and that is welcome. Ancient mysteries and action scenes are always fun. The main theme from the games appears, which was a nice addition.As an adaptation of the games, it falls massively short. The casting is horrendous. Tom Holland is way too young to play Nathan Drake, as he lacks the suave personality that makes Drake who he is. Nathan's personality is completely absent in this character. Drake's movie personality feels more like MCU Spider-Man than the Nathan Drake in the games. This character on the screen is not Nathan Drake. Mark Wahlberg as Sully is an equally bad casting. While it's unlikely that anyone on this cast played the games, this is just Marky Mark, with no resemblance to Sully whatsoever. The lack of the moustache hurts, but there's nothing at all to signify that this is supposed to be Sully. Sully in the games is a classic ""scoundrel with a heart of gold."" This guy is just a scoundrel. Wahlberg is also way too young to play Sully. Chloe was probably the closest to being like the games, but that's not saying much. She at least looks the part, which is more than what the others have going for them. She does the classic double agent thing from the games as well, which is one of the few things they got right. Elena is not in it at all, which was disappointing. The villains were bland, nothing more to say about them, other than that they squandered Antonio Banderas (although in fairness, most of the villains in the games are bland too). There's also a really awesome cameo from Nolan North, which was probably the best scene in the entire movie.If this movie wasn't connected at all to the Uncharted games, it would be a harmless action adventure movie that would have some similarities to the games, like how the games are inspired by adventure movies. By attaching it to the Uncharted franchise, it puts the expectation that it's going to be something like the games. While there are snippets of the games here and there, it's simply not enough. This does not feel like an Uncharted movie.By the way, the PlayStation Studios logo, with Nathan Drake, Kratos and Atreus (boy), Jin Sakai, Joel and Ellie, Aloy, and Sackboy was awesome. I guess we'll be seeing that on the upcoming Last of Us and Ghost of Tsushima adaptations.",1,1,/user/ur84421527/?ref_=tt_urv

Playing the game got me so hyped for this movie that I was hoping the bad scores and reviews I was seeing were lies. Unfortunately, they weren't.Playing the game mired my expectations because even Tom Holland couldn't save this film. He did a fine enough job, but he was never a convincing Nathan Drake. The emotional levels were short to non-existent. ""Why should I care if so and so died? Tom/Drake doesn't seem to really care.""Same goes for Mark Wahlberg. He never felt like he belonged playing Sully. He was unconvincing as a thief/backstabber. He was just weak. Don't get me wrong I love both actors just not here.The villain(s) were weakly utilized. They existed, but I felt no animosity towards them. They never brought the fear of death, or suspense, which really made me not care for any of them.I would say there were some positives to the film, but not many. It was entertaining to a certain degree, but not to ""Indiana Jones"" level like some have suggested.It was a slight bit funny as I got some chuckles throughout, but nothing that made me die of laughter.Visually the film was cool. Who doesn't like seeing a flying pirate ship battle? Tom Holland bringing out his inner Jack Sparrow. If I'm being honest the visuals were incredibly good. While some scenes gave off huge blue/green screen vibes. I was enormously impressed by how most of the time it didn't look like CGI. I was distracted by bad graphics and it felt like it was truly happening. Huge bonus there.Overall, an ok film that entertains. The acting is unconvincing, but the visuals are actually spectacular. Worth seeing in theatres?

tt1464335,ur117768316,6,18 February 2022,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a VERY big fan of the Uncharted game series. I own all of them and have played them all multiple times. I adore these characters and these stories. But, I tried by best to check my expectations at the door for a film adaptation.So, how is it as an adaptation of the source material? It's actually pretty good, despite the bizarre casting choices. Personally, I was okay with these choices as I thought that these actors did their best with what they were given to portray possible young versions of the games' characters.This film really inhabits the spirit of the games in terms of story, pacing, and action. The events that unfold here are completely implausible, the action sequences astoundingly over-the-top at times, but it is always fast-moving and really eye-catching.I had a great time watching the actual adventure stuff unfold here. In particular, the climax atop two pirate ships suspended from helicopters was dazzling and unique!The games have a LOT of expository dialogue, but because they're 12-15 hours long they can get away with this as they still have plenty of time for characterization.This movie, on the other hand, is somewhat lacking in the character department, but not because of its feature-length film runtime. It's because of all the double-crossing that the story includes; it never feels like we really get to know these characters beyond the facades that they put up. This film ultimately lacks the sense of camaraderie that the games possessed throughout.Thankfully, in the third act Nate and Sully have warmed up to each other to the point that their facades come down and by the end it really feels like we've made SOME progress with these characters.Ultimately, it's a serviceable introduction, and I really hope that this film is successful so we can get more films, this time with a stronger character bond between the two leads!",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur117768316/?ref_=tt_urv

-) No explanation why and how Nate and his brother are such history experts for exactly that story
-) Mark Wahlberg is just an older version of Tom Holland, but is he now rich and a master thief or clumsy as in the rest of the movie?-) The female antagonists are great, but one time they can open a lock easily, then they just put their knife in and wonder why it doesn't work
-) Let's shoot around in a café in the city center, no police will come anyhow
-) Creating a huge mess during a robbery but waiting in the car in front of the door is fine
-) Running and chasing each other works because you just pop out of nowhere and still be close to the hunted one
-) There are catacombs and secret rooms not found for hundreds or thousands of years, but well there is a club opened in it and you can see it from the sewer grill
-) The final treasure island is not only on the route, it is even called ""gold"" in Spanish, but nobody checked
-) There is a family resort on the treasure island, yet nobody ever went diving in the relevant cave, despite having markers there
-) You can also find the treasure ships from the whole in the ground above, but also here nobody ever hiked
-) Don't touch the worthy treasure ships as they are super fragile, but we pull them out roughly with the helicopter...
-) ... and despite I warned everyone not to damage it, we now fight on it and even crush both ships into each other to win the fight
-) I don't need the criminal wealthy mastermind, I can organize a huge logistics fleet for treasure transport...maybe Uber or somethingAnd this list would go on with no explanations on how and why. Sadly, these massive plot holes are ruining the whole entertainment around great visuals and action sequences a lot.When there is the ""raise the torch in a secret cave moment"" you immediately think, ""wait, this was there all the time?!""To sum up, Uncharted may be one of the better made video game movies out there, and it is for sure a brainless charming entertaining adventure flick.

An average film that comes directly out of the game, with imaginative (unscientific) exploits and intense (illogical) actions. I do realize that the movie's emphasis despite game-remake is the two actors' collaboration, but Mark Wahlberg once again gives us a cynical middle-aged man from Transformers, and Tom Holland is really the cunning version Peter Parker. Personally, I appreciate Holland's attempt in trying new characters with noticeable American accent and protruding emotional display, I can even conclude that his performance in Uncharted exceeds my expectation. However, this is not enough to escape the label of ""Spiderman"", as I couldn't help but wonder why he wouldn't shoot spider webs against the mercenaries. Change for the ""superheroes"" isn't unachievable: Christ Evans impressed me as the egocentric grandson in Knives Out, and Scarlett Johansson a suppressed wife in Marriage Story. With that face and muscles which Marvel popularized, it depends on Holland himself to find a passageway that'll surmount his previous career.",2,5,/user/ur125833174/?ref_=tt_urv

But as time grew on I was becoming less excited due to more things like the trailer and the casting for Tom Holland. But I watched it, and while I wouldn't call it a perfect adaption at all, this film is fun. It has all the elements of movies like Goonies, National Treasure, Mummy and of course Indiana Jones.

The plot twists were great.The ending pre-credits is so suspenseful and leaves room for a sequel.

tt1464335,ur123353548,7,25 February 2022,"Uncharted, one of the bestselling franchises of adventure games, follows Nathan Drake as he traverses the world uncovering various historical mysteries and treasures. If that sounds all too familiar, the Uncharted series basically serves as a playable version of an Indiana Jones movie; clues to solve, puzzles to unravel, and bad guys to escape from. By raising the standards of single player video games with a focus on high production value and quality, complex storytelling, Uncharted's method of storytelling has oft been favorably compared to Hollywood blockbuster storytelling. Those comparisons, after years of rumors and a revolving door of writers and directors, have finally come to fruition with Uncharted, directed by Ruben Fleischer and starring Tom Holland and Mark Whalberg.Nathan Drake, separated from his old brother Sam when they were kids 15 years prior, now works as a bartender. Approached by Walberg's Victor 'Sully' Sullivan to help finish an adventure that he and Sam started, Nathan is dragged into a world of adventurers, cutthroat thieves, and Scottish-accented rogues as they attempt to find explorer Ferdinand Magellan's lost treasure. After a slow first act where Fleischer takes his time establishing Nathan Drake as a character, the film's pace picks up a great deal with the entrance of Sully and the film's Mcguffin. From there, the film's 116-minute runtime flies by as they hop from location to location to get caught up in following clues through various mazes and puzzles. The chemistry between Nathan and Sully is the film's strongest suit as Holland and Whalberg bicker and quip their way through action scenes. Comparisons to Indiana Jones are inevitable (Indy is briefly mentioned in the film); having a book to guide them (a la Last Crusade), spikes protruding from walls (Raiders of the Lost Ark), and a traveling montage of an animated plane flying (every Indiana Jones movie), the film's tongue-in-cheek references and respect to the franchise lets audiences see the respect being given to the adventures that came before them.Starring Tom Holland, Uncharted seems to be set as another franchise for the young actor to put on his resume. When playing Peter Parker, Holland's greatest strength is his ability to play an almost manic nervousness as a kid overwhelmed in a world of superheroes and villains and his uncertainty in his role in the overall picture. Here in Uncharted, Holland projects a surefire confidence as Nathan Drake. While it's made clear throughout the film that Nathan is trying to find his brother Sam, it's also clear that Nathan is just as swept up in the mystery of it all as Sully is. That longing to find his brother, mixed with his quick wits when solving puzzles makes for a fun performance from Holland, but certainly not his best.Mark Whalberg, meanwhile, continues his string of shallow tough guy roles that seems to keep the actor alive and in business. In Uncharted, Whalberg manages to find a few moments to poke fun at the tough guy tropes (references to his aging body make for a few good jokes) while still ahering to the performances that have graced the majority of his career. As Sully, Whalberg is equal parts charming and slimy, a character we immediately like and also immediately know we shouldn't trust, but, like Nathan, would end up following anyway. Whalberg is in the film for just the right amount of time, disappearing somewhere towards the end of second act to give Holland and Sophia Ali's characters some time to breathe.Also starring Sophia Ali as Chloe Frazer (first introduced in Uncharted 2), the character is a walking 'no honor amongst thieves' cliche. Double crosses, triple crosses, and a constant wary eye makes Chloe's insertion into the group a boost to their overall dynamics and keeps both Nathan and Sully on constant guard. Ali is great in the role, introduced at the right time in the story, and one that hopefully will return for the inevitable sequel. Also starring Antonio Banderas as our primary villain Santiago Moncada, the veteran actor continues to prove that he still has it. A clever antagonist with a decent motivation of seeing his family restored to their former prominence, Banderas appears sporadically throughout the movie as he's always hot on the trail of Nathan and Sully. Rounding out the principal cast is Tati Gabrielle as Jo Braddock, employed by Santiago to work against Nathan and Sully. With more screen time than Banderas, Gabrille's character suffers the most from a lack of development and a lack of any real motivation. Her actions towards the third act, while meant to be played a surprise twist, comes off more unexpectedly random than calculated. Still, Gabrielle is serviceable with what she's given, and while Ali works as a foil for Nathan, Braddock's clear history with Sully gives her some fun exchanges with Walberg.Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Venom), Uncharted has proven that he's capable of handling big budget blockbusters. Fleischer and cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon have fun with the camera, keeping it moving in unique ways that lends energy and dynamism to each scene. The film's pacing is a bonus; from the second act on our characters get scant little time to breathe as they hop from set piece to set piece. It's clear Fleischer's intention was to keep his foot down on the adrenaline pedal as the story hurdles towards the third act climax; part of this might be to help hide some of the wonkier CGI that exists within the film, especially during that opening action scene and that same scene in full when the story loops back around to it. Still, thanks to a rousing score from red hot composer Ramin Djawadi, the music, the action, and the clear chemistry between the lead actors makes for an enjoyable time at the theater.Overall, Uncharted is easily the best video game adaptation Hollywood has managed to produce so far. Granted it's a low bar to clear, Fleischer's decision to focus on making a solid action-adventure movie first and an adaptation second pays off; Uncharted is just as entertaining for those who've never played the game as it is for those who have. Not the strongest performance from Holland, it's still clear to see that he and Whalberg had fun making this film and that fun translates from the set to the screen. While it'll likely appear on few top ten lists at the end of the year, Uncharted is an enjoyable, jet setting adventure that's sure to entertain and engage audiences for two hours; a popcorn flick cleverly snuck into the release schedule well ahead of summertime.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur123353548/?ref_=tt_urv

tt1464335,ur58447224,5,17 February 2022,"When Tom Holland was revealed to play Nathan Drake, I believe all of us were shocked by that decision, and not in a good way. For those of you who are aware of the video games, one thing that is for sure; Tom Holland does NOT look like Nathan Drake... at all.One thing leads to another, my expectation was low during yesterday's screening. Holland plays Drake and the trailer didn't even capture my interest, let alone the poster 🤣. And so it began...Uncharted is... an okay-ish film with an okay-ish CGI and an okay-ish storyline that doesn't meet the standard of its video games franchise.The major downside of the film lies in its adventure of solving mystery puzzles and finding hidden objects in which most of them just do NOT have the DNA of what makes the franchise great. It's missing the authenticity and the feels that the games provide to the audience. It's been somewhat tampered to make it look like a turndown version of the high-appraisal franchise. Instead of feeling rich with nature or artifacts, it feels empty with production sets that are not built solid enough to amplify its real-like mood and atmosphere. Just look at the poster smh.Quite surprisingly, Tom Holland did a pretty good job with playing Nathan Drake. His most profitable movie just came out 60+ days ago, but I was shocked to see that his performance didn't send a reminder that he was playing Spiderman. However, Drake should have been played by someone else; Tom just doesn't have the charisma, the aura or the handsome smirk. Mark Wahlberg is... Mark Wahlberg. Pretty sure he's tired of acting.The storyline isn't all that great either, it's just not adventurous enough. There are so many cities they travelled to, that they forgot the heart of Uncharted lies in territories of ancient buildings or concretes. It seems that the decision makers behind this movie are not even fans of the games.The best thing to happen is the final 30 minutes, a mixture of Mission Impossible, Tomb Raider & Pirates of the Carribean all in one, that's where the adrenaline really kicks in and I believe most of the budget that went to making of the film is used here. Did you see the best part in the trailer? This is where it all happens. There was even one scene here that successfully sways its camera just like you're watching a clip of the game, kudos.There's a tiny twist that occurred in the middle and I was surprised of how it turned out to be because I wasn't expecting it at all. It occurred so suddenly, it caught me off guard. Not sure about you gamers, but that is a good twist for me.As for me, this is better than 2018's Tomb Raider but it's still mapped 'uncharted' to be on par with National Treasure or Indiana Jones.Verdict: A journey not-so-worth remembering, Uncharted is missing its most valuable treasure; a heart of gold to making this film a success.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur58447224/?ref_=tt_urv

Please redact the usage), Tom Holland. Cashing in on the Spiderman fever, Uncharted seems to have garnered all the interest over the weekend solely due to Holland's presence. Holland is well within his comfort zone as he gets to play the action hero yet again, faces similar trauma (losing someone close) & has a mentor. Mark Wahlberg returns to the big screen with ease as he picks up a role he has done upmteen times before. Their chemistry is enjoyable though. Antonio Banderas is cast as the Latino bad guy (since Hollywood doesn't have other options), Sophia Taylor Ali (The Wilds) & Tati Gabrielle (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) co-star.If you want to know the meaning of generic, then look no further.

The biggest draw of the whole movie was the pacing. You don't wait too long for anything. It sucked me in right from the start and didn't let go until the end. The action was great and there was plenty of it. Something was constantly happening and it even worked in the finale except for the ending, which although was great on the action side, I didn't like much on the story side. It was good, but it was too fast. At the end the pace could have slowed down a bit and finished the story properly and speaking of the plot, it was... how can you say. Not to mention the gameplay was good, but from the perspective of someone who's played all four episodes, it's probably a bit of a pain. There are a few changes to the script. Personally, I think either the movie shouldn't have followed the story of the game at all and made it their own, or if they did follow the game, they should have made it accurate. It's a shame. It's a bit of a mess. But what threw the movie off the most for me was the character of Sully, which I didn't think matched the in-game one, and that was a bit annoying in places for a fan of the franchise. To sum it up. If you go into the movie thinking you haven't played the games, I think this will be a good action flick for you. If you go to the movie as a player of the franchise, you'll probably have some things to fault it for. But I still enjoyed the movie as an Uncharted gamer and consider it one of the better game adaptations.

I cannot however give it any leniency as it has a name, and legacy to live up to.Tom Holland, and Mark Wahlberg give good performances, and have solid chemistry I personally don't care to much for either of them as Nathan, and Sully. I especially didn't care to much for Wahlberg as Sully, and what they did to Sully... well more on that later.The movie has some great cinematography, good CGI, and some solid action sequences. Everything about this film is solid but it does not do much in living up to it's Uncharted title.Now for Sully, and this is where the film loses a point. What they did to Sully was terrible, now yes Sully is a conman, a thief, and a bit of a sleeze bag but that's part of his charm and why we like him. With that being said Sully would not backstab Nathan, ever! Doing so to others sure, but even when Nathan and Sully first met he wouldn't. Sully took Nathan under his wing, and Sully saw a lot of himself in Nathan.Other issues like Sully's classic lines aren't around such as ""well I'll be go to hell"" or ""I'm sweating like a hooker in church"" soo many great lines that Sully had throughout the franchise, and to not at least drop one of them is such a huge missed opportunity. To be fair though that cameo from a certain someone had me fanboy all over, it made me very happy.I wish I could've enjoyed this film more, and if this was just a another action adventure film I'd be more lenient but this is Uncharted, and unfortunately the Uncharted title does not help.4/10Watched in Theaters.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur39717569/?ref_=tt_urv

In fact at some point one character even asks ""When did you decide to become Indiana Jones?

There are some biases against game adaptations in the movie industry but it doesn't mean that all game adaptations are bad. In case of Uncharted, I think it is one of better adaptations among game adaptations however there is not anything in the movie that we didn't see before. The movie did not bore me because its pace is fast enough for an action movie. The movie uses common formula in that has been used action adventure movies since Indiana Jones so it can be said that it is another clone of Indiana Jones. I think Uncharted is more than a simple clone because it has most of the elements of a good action movie. It has powerful chemistry between the lead actors and some of its action scenes were very entertaining especially the scenes take place in the auction and in the ship. Plus a few good surprises has been added to movie for those who played the games before.The movie's twist was unexpected but it was not so effective because villains were insufficient to pose a real threat to the hero. Lead actors don't resemble so much to their game character versions and their characterization is little bit different than their characterization in the game. Since it is a prequel to games some differences can be accepted until a point but the casting could have been better but I don't mind the casting so much because the lead actors' chemistry was so good. Age rating disturbed me because no blood and gore have been shown in action scenes. Even the games took 16+ rating so 10+ rating is humiliating in a way.To sum up, Uncharted is a movie that doesn't present something unique in the action-adventure genre but it is a good action movie to spend time on.

tt1464335,ur79101136,8,26 February 2022,"I HAVE PLAYED ALL OF THE UNCHARTED GAMESWelcome to a movie that has been in the works sense i believe 2008! Was it rushed? Absolutely!Did they pull it off...? Of course they did!!!Follow Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) and Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) as they find the treasure that was lost in the form of a PREQUEL to the games.The positive:
Tom Holland did a fantastic job and i my eyes, i never saw him as ""Peter Parker"" in this movie. I always saw who he was playing...
the story was good enough that i could believe it and the movie had great pacing
i thought our ""love interest"" was good and i like that they used Chloe as that love interest so that if they follow the formula of the games then it'll be a fun reunion for the search of shambala
the action was great and i thought Tom did a great job of representing it in this movie
i'll talk about the score in a minute but along with that, i loved when they brought in the ORIGINAL Drake's theme from time to time
having a short 5 second Nolan North cameo made me smile so much and made me finally realize that i was watching an Uncharted moviethe bad:
Mark Wahlberg unfortunately doesn't really play Victor Sullivan here... he plays Mark Wahlberg in a trash low budget action film. And that makes me sad. I hope if they do sequels actually based on the first game that they make sully old and they recast mark
they had their own score for the movie that they used most of the time and it was so garbage compared to the original one. It made no sense to me why they didn't use the original one and only teased itbut other than all that, this movie was still enjoyable whether or not you played the games8.5/10.",0,2,/user/ur79101136/?ref_=tt_urv

tt1464335,ur88363888,3,19 February 2022,"A lifeless experience hampered further by the incessant chatting around me in the cinema. This is a film we have all watched at least ten times. If you think it looks just like every other cash grab action film attached to an already developed franchise I can assure that you are exactly right.Uncharted is based on the single player adventure puzzle games with the same name. To put it simply its a treasure hunt story akin to National Treasure.In fact if you've seen National Treasure you have basically already seen Uncharted, they are incredibly similar. There is not a single original concept in Uncharted, I'm not saying every film has to be a completely individual unique experience but every film, at least in my eyes, should strive for excellence. Uncharted had its eyes set on money and I'm sure it will achieve this, funding countless bland sequels for the next decade.Well, what can you really expect from the director that brought you Venom and the sub-par Zombieland? Not much and you don't get much.The cinematography and framing is competent yet bland, no different to any other of these types of action films really, other than one long take which I found quite visually appealing.The action follows suit, competent but just not all that interesting. There are constant inconsistencies, my favourite revolving around the weight of gold, and much of it was so unrealistic and over choreographed that it was hard to keep track of what was going on.One positive thing I will say is to do with the film's pacing and tone. Although Uncharted is bland I can't say I was ever bored, thanks mainly to the rather short runtime, even then I think they could have cut quite a lot to make it even smoother. The tone is consistently cheerful which meant the film avoided the sad ending to act 2 trope that always bugs me to death. However, in exchange the stakes always felt very low preventing my full engagement.I never thought Tom Holland would be right for the role and I can confirm my suspicions were true. He is simply too young and lacks a lot of charm a character like Nathan Drake needs. I also really despised the line delivery from all the actors in a lot of scenes, it might have been more of an audio mixing problem but a lot of the time I struggled to understand what they were saying.Uncharted is bland and not worth your time, please do not waste your money watching this.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur88363888/?ref_=tt_urv

tt1464335,ur73501762,7,20 February 2022,"If you are a fan of Uncharted... stay away from this movie. If you, like me, just want a fun albeit mindless and generic action adventure movie, this is an enjoyable flick! It's by no means a ""good movie"" but it's all around fun and enjoyable. It's in no way a new ""Indiana Jones"" for the modern age, but it does offer a few unique thrills along the way! For reference, I went in with low expectations and not really any prior knowledge of the Uncharted games, so my review is fully based on the movie itself, and may seem a little more positive than most because it wasn't hard for it to exceed my expectations.The biggest thing this movie has going for it is Tom Holland. If Tom Holland wasn't in this movie, I don't think I would have enjoyed it near as much. The film is truly driven by his charisma. I truly think Holland is one of the best action stars and actors in Hollywood right now, he was able to really carry this movie despite everything else working against him, such as the fact that he was very miscast. He is not at all Nathan Drake, but that's not his fault, and he gives this role his all to try and deliver something worthwhile to fans. And damn, he really is so charming and likeable, and not only that but single-handedly improves the movie just by being in it. He shows here that he isn't just Peter Parker, he's an action star in the vein of Tom Cruise! He has this laser-like physical precision and confidence in his physicality, he sells the fights and action scenes so well and its very clear to see he did a lot of his own stunts, much like Cruise! Seeing him do flips, crazy jumps and every other stunt is exhilarating and makes the film feel different from most modern action fare; it makes this feel a little more special than all of the other ""Indiana Jones wannabes"". Holland just did such a good job here, easily the highest point of the movie. He has the charisma, comedic timing, and the physicality for the action!Now to get into some of the more mixed aspects. To continue with the cast, Mark Wahlberg felt a little off as Sully, and I hate to say it but I didn't feel much chemistry between him and Holland or any of the other characters for that matter. And thats not the actors faults. I truly think it comes down to the lacklustre direction and the uninspired, mediocre script. The direction is very poor, and I knew it would be going in. Ruben Fleischer is someone who the studios hire as a last resort replacement, he just has no artistic voice and directs what's on the page, not adding any intensity or style. Compared to his other work such as with Venom, this is his most ambitious project yet, and I thought he did fine by his standards, but this film could have used a much more talented filmmaker at the helm. The production value did feel quite slick however, especially with the action scenes. The setpieces are incredible, they are so much fun and bring so much spectacle! While a little preposterous, I did love final 3rd act setpieces with the flying pirate ships! The action is just so well done, fight sequences are so slick and I think that just comes down to how well the actors sold it... because the script sure didn't do it any favours.This screenplay is not great, and is easily the biggest weakness of this film. The plot was so disjointed and didn't feel like a movie, just a collection of moments and plot points. It was very uninspired and felt mandated by studio execs who thought they knew Uncharted. But believe it or not... this script completely lacks the personality of Uncharted. It also just lacks story and character development, merely just serves as a connection between the action scenes, which is fun, but doesn't make for a good movie. It has some very silly moments too, such as the treasure hunting and map following elements which were absolutely ridiculous. It just asked for too much suspension of disbelief from the audience. For example, there's a very ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" like moment where the characters are in hidden chambers underneath the city, and the movie asks us to believe that the city just built itself around these hidden clues and rooms. One of the clues happens to be perfectly preserved in a Papa Johns restaurant (and yes I hated the blatant product placement), which just seemed so ridiculous to me. The movie also seemed to lose steam at times, but wisely used music to pick up the energy. It also tries way too hard to set up sequels rather than to tell a good, self-contained story.But ultimately, I still had lots of fun with this movie. Trust me, its not the greatest thing you'll see by any means, but if you're looking for a fun action adventure this is a good time! While its no ""Indiana Jones"", it does happen to be much more enjoyable than ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" at least! Its honestly one of the more solid adventure movies in recent memory, but it is not at all an Uncharted movie. And yeah, the screenplay and direction isn't great, but the gorgeous locations, humour, action and cast do a lot to help make the movie a really fun time! Especially Tom Holland! I'd honestly see it for Tom Holland alone; he is the highlight of this movie, its completely driven by his physicality and charisma!

Chung-hoon Chung really did his thing with the cinematography and brought that video game element to life.I also liked the Tom and Mark duo which seemed to have this Tom and Jerry vibe (minus the chase).Could've Been Better: The character development and follow through of Nate Drake was lazy. I mean, there is no justification for how he turns out as an adult. This also doesn't help the theme to be carried out effectively due to the person who is supposed to be important to him-his brother-not even treated as such in his arc...at least not treated with a certain level of priority.OTHER THOUGHTS:1. The most exciting moment of the film for me was the plane scene. It was as if it was pulled directly from the game itself.2. I loved Tati, I really did, but that fight choreography with the museum security looked choreographed and moved a little slow.3. An orphan turned adult pickpocket takes on a childhood dream opportunity to hunt for a historical treasure, presented by a stranger with ties to his brother who not only introduced him to the dream opportunity when they were young, but who has also been MIA for a few years. This is Uncharted.The strength of this film is Acts Two and Three when the opportunity is in motion and center stage. The engagement is watching the characters on this scavenger hunt of sorts which I think is the basis of the PS4 game.My issue with the story is the lack of follow through with Nate Drake being interested in treasure hunting. There's this short conversation that happens in the first 8-10 minutes, and then after that... Nate is a grown man who works as a bartender when he's not picking pockets. Like, huh?There was also the first 3-5 minutes of the film giving a foreshadow with the intent of showing young vs older Nate as if that was supposed to be something to look forward to? It was a waste of 5 minutes, in my opinion, in addition to a waste of the first Act.4. Now how is it that Nate had to swim ""under and over"" to get there... but then when Tati got there, she order her boat straight through an opening? Talk about poor editing.5. Oh... wait.... To piggyback off point #1, I think my other favorite scene was with the ships... now that was also exciting to watch and felt directly out of a video game.6. I really enjoyed the charming interactions between Tom and Mark. With this film seemingly being a ""pilot"" for a possible franchise, I look forward to seeing how this partnership continues to develop. I can see them being like the yt Will Smith and Martin Lawrence of Bad Boys.Additionally, I really enjoyed Sophia Ali and she may have honestly helped to elevate the interactions between our male leads, and help Tom shine a little bit more.HOWEVER... the development and follow through of the characters were pretty lazy. As mentioned with my comment about the story/plot, Act One really rushed my ability to understand Nate Drake. I mean, everything after the first 10 minutes with Nate felt like a totally different person-like, how does a innocent child with this nerd-adjacent interest in history become a member of misdemeanors, and a martial artist? And at least due to the genre, I could've accepted the martial art had it been attached to a well developed character.7. The messaging that I felt the film attempted to get through was this idea around what makes a family. Unfortunately, the idea of ""family"" via Nate's brother felt more like an after thought that was strategically, but poorly, edited in.On the plus side, the partnership between Nate and Vic sums up the initial idea in a pretty decent way...even though it sums it more like a partnership than a brotherhood.8. In addition to my concern about the life shift from childhood to adulthood, how was he able to be such a skillful ""pickpocket-eur""?9. Not the cat! LOL10. In the first 15-20 minutes of the film, I said to myself, ""This film is moving pretty good. I like how it's wasting no time getting to the core motivation/premise of the game.""And for the most part, this film moves in a quick, fun, and engaging way-especially Acts Two and Three. My issue with the pacing is that it moves too fast with developing and following through on Nate's character. Luckily, Acts Two and Three's focus on the hunt is enough of a distraction.* * *
Overall #Uncharted gives Red Notice - meets Legends of the Hidden Temple - meets Shang Chi.You know, this isn't ""theater-worthy great,"" but isn't a bad viewing when needing a little down time...at home...although I am not sure if certain scenes would have the same impact if on regular tv... which means the film should've invested more in those blockbuster elements throughout the entire film vs those isolated moments.I will say I am interested in seeing what the next film will give, particularly the charming partnership between Tom and Mark.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur141983543/?ref_=tt_urv

Despite so many changes being made that they could have made them Rafe and Nadine and nothing would have changed.Tom Holland was okay as a young Nate, but a little too wide-eyed innocent. I could not buy Mark Wahlberg as Sully. He was so one-note throughout the entire film, except one scene at the end. That was a major miscast. Sully can be selfish, but he cares about people close to him. Given who Sully knew in the film, he should not have been treating Nate like he did.Again, it's a game to film adaptation. If you don't play the games, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.I still feel that National Treasure with Nicholas Cage is a better Uncharted film than Uncharted 2022.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur27836728/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur65273437,6,25 February 2022,"I'm going to be honest, I didn't know what to expect from this, from the trailers it looked like your typical action-adventure but you never know from video games adaptions given their not-so-good track record but I'm glad to say I enjoyed this for the most part.The performance from Tom Holland as Nathan Drake was good, really it was never gonna be a spot on reflection from the games but as the feel is concerned Tom Holland put in a good performance that makes you feel he is playing Nathan Drake in this case a younger Nathan Drake from the games, and that's all I wanted cause I was concerned he was gonna simply act as himself or a typecast of Peter Parker (not saying he does this is all his movies as he has proven to be a very good actor, especially from his acting roles from No Way Home, Cherry or Devil All The Time) but that wasn't the case as he goes do a decent job of portraying Nathan's charm, humor, confidence and off-brand witt from the games.However, although I did enjoy seeing Mark Wahlberg as Sully onscreen I felt like his portrayal of Sully was a mixed bag goes he goes in and out of the role. For example, when he is first introduced in the movie he does do a decent job in playing Sully(a young version of him I keep forgetting lol) and genuinely puts in effort but in some parts of the movie it seems like he just acts as himself(the loud talking, quick witted and often erratic roles Mark Wahlberg is known for) and that might rub some fans the wrong way, I wouldn't say he was miscast but it was jarring to see but his saving grace was the chemistry with him and Tom Holland as Sully and Nathan was charming and very good and captured their banter and mirrored their relationship in the games quite a bit. Antonio Banderas although it is a joy to see him on screen he plays your generic bad guy who has Daddy issues and kills without a thought and that was disappointing so see, also Tati Gabrielle who played another villain showed some signs of being a badass was just another generic bad guy weak motivations. Also, Sophia Ali as Chloe was decent and she worked well with Tom and Mark.The Story is nothing special as it's your typical adventure/treasure hunt but the games were really never known for their storytelling but its unique characters, set pieces and epic action-adventure and although the movie isn't perfect in hitting all those notes it does do a good job of capturing the set pieces and adventure aspect of the games to a decent amount and you can see Sony did their homework and put some care into this project and it's quite entertaining to watch on screen. Although predictable at times, especially some of the twists and turns that the movie tries but you could see from a mile away it had heart to the story as you follow Nate's journey and his motivation to find treasure and his lost brother. Even though it does hit some of the same notes from adventure movies you've seen before I was entertained still cause of the characters mostly Nathan and Sully, the humor was actually pretty well balanced and not forced and funny for the most part. The visual effects and CGI were spot on I mean Sony rarely disappoints on the visual effects on its high-budget movies. The pacing, for the most part, was decent was well balanced but at times it felt kinda slow but it wasn't a major problem and the action was decent and there were some memorable stunts too especially from Tom Holland's action set-pieces as Nathan Drake, especially in the third act was enjoyable and high energy and some pretty decent nods and references to the games too.So as I stated Uncharted at the end of the day is not the Perfect video game adaption that will blow everyone's mind but considering the low amount of good video game movies I'm glad this is a decent movie that I rather enjoyed from the performances from Tom Holland and his chemistry with Mark Wahlberg as Nathan and Sully, the humor and mostly entertaining action and set pieces. Although generic at times this is a success for Sony and a step in the right direction for the future of Video Game Movie adaptions.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur65273437/?ref_=tt_urv

This movie captured several moments reminiscent of the games in a way that was unique enough that I didn't feel like I was watching the cinematics of the games.As a film enthusiast, this movie had several elements that annoyed me. It seemed like the writers were trying to fit too much plot into one film. It got confusing who was backstabbing who and who was the actual villain.Overall, I liked it.

They just have this amazing atmosphere that absorbs you into the game, with great humor, badass characters and stunning visuals.Well, the movie nails a few of this aspects. Against all criticism, I think Holland ist a great young Nate. He has the charme, the humor and even the look to be a younger Nathan Drake. The thing most people forget is that in the games, Nate is a mass-murdering thief that steals precious relicts and destroys ancient temples. He's not much of a likeable character, but he becomes one when we play him. It's a challenge to portray him well in the movies. And Holland did that.I also liked the casting choice for Chloe. The only fail is Mark Wahlberg, as usual.This movie has action, it has riddles, it has over the top action scenes and it has humor. So, I guess when you're a hardcore Uncharted Fan or when you need to question the logic behind every scene, this movie is not for you.

tt1464335,ur127480300,7,21 February 2022,"Most have been the movies that have tried to adapt video games and have failed. Of course with a few exceptions, like Sonic or Detective Pikachu, not because they are any good but rather because they give to what people would expect from that IP.And over Sonic or Pikachu, I think Uncharted delivers on it better than them, it's fun cast and crystal clear goals to achieve are pretty well implemented, plus the chemistry of both titular characters is almost palpable, but almost. It does fail at certain times, and it feels like it takes too long for characters to make up their minds about what or who they want to be.Tom Holland's Nathan Drake is a cartoon character, and while they are honest displays of emotion they don't match the one of the games. I think one of the main problems in the movie in relation to the game is Tom's persona doesn't match Drake. But that is understandable due to the fact that this is rather an origin story than an actual game-based Uncharted story, and that is very clear right from the get go in the orphanage scene, homaging Uncharted IV.I won't lie and say that I have played lord of the games, but for what I've played, you can feel the tonal differences.The villain is also very poorly constructed, I'd have rather they kept Antonio Bandera's character for one main reason, he has screen prescience, why? Because he in Antonio Banderas!The villain they replace it to who her name I forget, is incredibly bland and with lack of proposition, lacks that I haven't felt so great ever in a movie theater. She is not plain evil, she is just...nothing, at all. She is one of the least intimidating villains I have seen.However it has surprising good interpretations, from Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland, with the give material constraints.There are some also lacks if complete sense, for example when Tom and Ali are in the red car, that Tom falls on a bunch of stuff with great speed and height and does not brake any bones I pass it, but when he lands on the car he stands in it, without holding to it and does not fly off. All the previous stuff were unlikely but possible, but they were still achievable and respected certain rules, like having to hold themselves not to fall, because GRAVITY, but in that moment is like Tom forgot he is not playing Spider-Man, but the sequence is still well made and it is a lot of fun besides it.Uncharted has a charming vibe that will keep viewers from getting bored at all times, it has more similarities to Shang-Chi, than to the games but it pays respects to it with its great set and action pieces. Characters are fun to see and they provide with a great movie but with great lack of porpoise as to why it exists or does stuff, but it does not fail in the attempt to bring something fun that does not treat the viewers like they should know all the characters and stories they have been through. 7/10.",1,1,/user/ur127480300/?ref_=tt_urv

Tom Holland puts on a great performance, but I'll never see Nathan Drake in his face. In addition, the confusing mix-up comes from four different parts. Even if the action in the games is still a hundred times better, the film convinces tremendously when it comes to the action, unrealistic and crazy to the point of no more. Well, we've seen these scenes already in the game, but that's how Uncharted was and should be. The biggest bright spot that remains for me is a cameo by Nolan North, the real Nathan Drake. Goosebumps, so I would like to experience Nathan's story on the Playstation again with the controller instead of in the cinema.

Sony basically constructed their own story with young Nate and Sully while still keeping its source material. This movie is probably more of a 7.5/8 in my opinion, but obviously giving it a 10 for the immature people that rate it a 1/10 because it's not what they wanted. This movie had just about everything you'd want out of an Uncharted adaptation. The wit, the action, the treasure hunting; it's got it all. Highly recommend this movie to really anybody fan of the games or not. Not to mention we get a fantastic cameo and 2 really well made post credit scenes, hopefully hinting for a second film.

Starring Tom Holland as ""Nathan Drake"" a bartender with a brain full of knowledge of ancient history he just also happens to be a amateur thief with parkour talents. I know he's like a gumbo pot of the most random abilities. After ""Nathan"" is approached by a treasure Hunter/ con man ""Victor Sullivan"" played by Mark Wahlberg about finding the lost treasure of ""Ferdinand Magellan"" that was lost some 500 years ago by the house of Moncada.""Nathan"" is hesitant even though he had dreams of one day trying to find this treasure with his brother who he's only had contact with through post cards the last ten years. After ""Nathan"" finds out his brother ""Sam"" was helping ""Victor"" find the treasure he joins in. But of course there is more to the story and other more dangerous people also on the hunt for the treasure.Like ""Santiago Moncada"" played by Antonio Banderas who's family has direct connection to the treasure. Also the assassin he's hired ""Braddock"" played by Tati Gabrielle who you might remember as one of the twisted sisters from ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" on Netflix. There's also victor on again off again partner ""Chloe Frazer"" played by Sophia Ali. Everyone is in on the hunt for this treasure and willing to do anything to get to it. You see ""Nathan"" an overall nice person jump feet first in this cesspool of characters just hoping it will bring him closer to his brother and maybe a little richer.""Uncharted"" if you didn't know is a popular Sony PlayStation video game. I never played it but I can see why they made it into a film. On top of having a strong following it has a foundation you can build upon. It's an adventure game with action and they tried to bring that to the big screen. They toned it down so more kids could watch because you have ""Spider-Man"" himself starring in it.""Uncharted"" was like a combo of ""National Treasure"", ""Mission Impossible"", and ""Cocktail"". ""Nathan Drake"" character bio seemed to pull from Tom Holland's ""Peter Parker"", ""Ethan Hunt"" from ""Mission Impossible"" with like the brains of ""Benjamin Franklin Gates"" from the film ""National Treasure"". During scenes I was like oh that's very Mission Impossible Esq. The only difference is it would of been less CGI and actual stunts taken place on location.The film was watered down with certain violent scenes losing effect when no blood came out the body. Some scenes were over the top and just not believable. Your suppose to be in a cave that no one has been in or seen in 500 years but I can see it from the street looking down the sewer. They're a lot of eye role moments. The film was just ok. It has actors in it I really love and enjoy a lot of their work. But this was just your middle tier film. Of course it will kick off a franchise because of how many ""Uncharted"" games they have but I don't know how that will go with Tom Holland trying to take a step back from acting. I give ""Uncharted""three more fires 🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

Mark Wahlberg actually works as Victor Sullivan, he completely botches a depictment of Sullivan but he does his own version and he succeeds.Tom Holland also works as Nathan Drake but there were so many other choices to play that role. The innocent, childish and young Holland puts on a performance where there is little to criticize because he is so likeable, but is this Nathan Drake? Or have we gotten a completely different story where the other is innocent as hell and the other plans to make his personality his cat.The story lacks because of the extremely generic villains. The spaniord is double-crossed and killed halfway through the film where this girl apparently takes over as a new main villain. The problem is they built up the spaniords character, not hers. So we are left with this mysterious character who in the end accomplishes nothing.The stakes in this movie are sorely lacking. It always feels like it doesn't matter how many hits Nate takes, it doesn't leave a scratch and as usual the opposing troups have seemingly bottom tier iq.Nevertheless the film is watchable and entertaining, and leaves room for promising upcoming sequels that we might enjoy even more. It's a hollywoodized version of Uncharted which is acceptable but it leaves this generic non-risk taking duo that has no depth in character.

-Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are clearly having fun.-The action scenes are bonkers but a blast to see on screen.-A cinematic treasure hunt is always a good time.-The entire 3rd act of the film is the definition of a popcorn flick.CONS:
-Everything in this film has been done before by better movies.I've never really played the Uncharted games, so I get to review this just as a film instead of an adaptation and as a film, I had a good fun time with this. Which is rare with a Hollywood film these days!!! The movie is just out to entertain you and take you on another cinematic treasure hunt. The action scenes make no logical sense, but this movie isn't interested in logic, it just wants you to have a good time and I did. Seeing two helicopters carrying two pirate ships and crashing into each other is the type of silliness I enjoy while eating my popcorn! The biggest problem is if you've seen any Indiana Jones or National Treasure movies, you've seen all this before.

Ends up verymuch feeling like a lesser Marvel ending battle where a director seems to just turn whatever is left of the budget over to the effects team and let them do whatever.All in all, a fun movie that doesn't outstay it's welcome, despite the last twenty or so minutes feeling like pretty flat action.",0,0,/user/ur29605411/?ref_=tt_urv

But neither of them can rescue a script that shaves off every nuance and detail that made the games script & acting so well regarded.In true treasure hunting movie style, the action zips around the world at breakneck speed, as the leads get into fights, steal and break priceless artifacts, while constantly quipping and double crossing one another.The two female leads, Sophia Ali & Tati Gabrielle bring something new & occasionally interesting to their roles (well Sophia does, it's more about the look for Tati), but it's not enough to push it much past 'meh' territory.Overall Uncharted is a very average treasure hunting action movie, disguised by its hyper kinetic pace. You'll likely have an ok time while watching, but ultimately it'll leave you feeling a bit hollow, hoping to God that the film makers can do better for the inevitable sequel.",0,0,/user/ur96743324/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur103076708,8,19 February 2022,"I was very doubtful going into this movie as I was concerned it was going to contradict itself in terms of lore and backstory, as previously established in the games. Especially since I was EXTREMELY unhappy with the casting of Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan, as his persona is so night and day with the character we see in the gameThat being said, I let most of that go when I was watching the movie because I was having so much fun with it!Without going into too many spoilers, yes the game's story is different from that of what we see in the games, and Mark Wahlberg's Sully isn't the same person we see in the games, but within the context of what I consider to be another version of the story, I think it works really well. Tom Holland brought his own spin on Nathan Drake and I thought he was great, Wahlberg grew on me over time as Sully and he had me invested in his character. Sophia Taylor Ali was a wonderful Chloe Frazer, and she felt like the closest to their respective character in the games if that's what you're looking for. And of course, Antonio Banderas and Tati Gabrielle were excellent villains perfect for an action adventure such as this oneThe story felt very appropriate for an uncharted property, and even had some winks and nods to lifelong series fans who played through a few of the exact situations in the games. It really does feel like you could make an installment in the game franchise with this exact story (With exceptions to maintain backstory consistency). Along with the action being so so so entertaining! Considering Nate's just now jumping into this life, it makes sense he's not comfortable breaking necks and getting into gunfights quite yet. But thankfully, that doesn't take away from the stakes or the excitement. The mixture of practical effects and excellent stunt work meant that the cgi they did use could have more time dedicated to it looked super clean, which I hate to say is rare nowadaysDid I mention this movie is actually really funny? Props to the writers for making me laugh throughout the movie, which can become irritating if it's not done properly. I honestly can't think of a joke I heard that fell flat, and none of the comedy felt inappropriately timed, which a lot of movies tend to do, compromising the moments that need to digest as serious tonal shifts. It was well done, and I gotta give credit where it's dueI do still have issues with it though, even if they are mostly nitpicks. The emotional moments didn't really stick the landing, and just about every time someone had tears in their eyes I didn't buy it. The child versions of Nate and Sam didn't have the greatest acting ability, although they weren't by any means terrible. And yeah I wish this movie was more consistent with the backstory we got in the games, because it would've made the whole franchise feel like one odyssey. I understand them taking another direction to create another story, but it would've been cooler in my opinionFlaws aside, in the end this was a great time at the movies, and I'm glad to see that Video Game movies do have a future ahead of them. As long as you understand this isn't necessarily the same universe as the stories we've seen on the PlayStation, I think you'll walk out of this fulfilled. If you haven't played any of the games, this might actually be what gets you interested even!

tt1464335,ur36071468,7,15 February 2022,"I'm a huge fan of the games, so when the trailer came out, it was hard to understand how they could make everything so wrong, and honestly, that's how I felt throughout the whole first hour of the film, until the movie revealed its true intentions. It does not want to be an adaptation of the games, in fact three lines spoken after the plane sequence suddenly make this film quite enjoyable. I will not spoil anything, but a very clever nod to the games is made and it suddenly makes this movie very understandable because it just wants to be a good film that tries as hard as it can to separate itself from the games and states it, perhaps too late, perhaps not cleverly, but states it is a sort of story set in a parallel universe - Tom Holland's trademark surely.So it definitely will outrage some fans, but honestly, once one acknowledges this nod and understands it does nothing but rip off the trademarks of the games to make it a small entertaining film, then why the hell not, I'd watch a sequel. It is not the best game adaptation for I believe it is quite hard to beat the first Tomb Raider by Simon West, but it's a funny film people who never played the games can enjoy without really having to know anything about the characters beforehand. Then again, it's not a great film for it could have tried some originality here and there and ends up being quite an average Hollywood production that does not set any high expectations nor even tries to make this treasure hunt as interesting as an Indiana Jones can do it. The director does not try anything new and the actors aren't really giving any performance worth remembering, even Antonio Banderas does not give his best as the pseudo villain that in the end cannot be perceived as a real threat to any of the characters. There are not many action sequences and way too much dialogue to explain the obvious. It is quite sad to see that the post credit scenes are a better movie than the actual film but yet again, it's worth the price of a ticket and I don't think anyone will regret enjoying this film.

Most of the action scenes have way too many chops and cuts, leaving the viewer nauseated watching them. The story works great for the game, but for a movie, even at 2 hours feel incomplete and has multiple plot holes.

They play off of each other very nicely and their chemistry delivers some of the funny scenes in the film. Antonio Banderas was also pretty good as our antagonist, then again if he can pull off a ginger cat wearing boots in Shrek, then he should rightfully be good here. The action sequences, particularly the final battle on two pirate ships in the air was honestly really intense. There were some really fun situations that are thrown at our characters here. And it leaned much further into the adventure side of things as I expected, but I am of course unfamiliar with the games like I said.But, it does feel in places like Whalberg and Holland are just playing themselves in an adventure film. Nothing too off-putting though. And quite a lot of the humour didn't land, although there were some standout moments which made me chuckle. My final point to make is that if you're expecting a grounded and realistic action film, then you aren't going to find it here. There are plenty of moments that defied all laws of physics, but I didn't care. I expected a fun if not silly action film, and that's what I got; and I couldn't be happier.From a film standpoint and ignoring the games, this movie was highly entertaining, with some exciting action scenes and enjoyable characters.

I always liked Tom in the role of Nate even when others didn't. I never once thought to myself when watching that is was too similar of a portrayal to Spider-man, in fact I thought the exact opposite and was so happy to see him in a role where he is a bit more ""grown up"" and doing things Spider-man would never. Sully was better in the final act and I look forward to seeing where he goes in a sequel. Chloe was played well too and I think the cast has a bright future. Stunning visuals, great sets, and amazing action and stunts, very important in an Uncharted adaptation. One thing I am a bit sceptical on is some of the origins and reframing of the characters background and history, however I'm willing to wait for a sequel to judge and see how it pans out and if it pays off/ is worth the changes.

As with any Video Game adaptation, I went into this as a Skeptic (see Assassin's Creed). My reservations would be justified after seeing this movie.Look, I absolutely LOVE seeing Mark Wahlberg in just about anything and Tom Holland is a capable actor. But, this movie was cast COMPLETELY WRONG. Victor Sully is 20-30yrs the senior to Nathan Drake and his portrayal of Sully was more selfish, more physically capable and less the father-figure Nathan Drake has in the game.Tom Holland was way too upper class and his sarcasm was not even close to the real character. Nathan Drake is a rough, weathered treasure hunting veteran and he was overshadowed too much in this movie, as Sully was more the star of the show (which, in every single game in the franchise, always was a background assisting character).Now, if you enjoy action movies, this is for you. But, there are so many ridiculously UNBELIEVABLE action sequences that defy the laws of air speed, freefalls among others, which take place on an open C-130. There are 400yr old wooden ships being airlifted out of a cave, which clearly would have crumbled at the thought of movement.Overall, I feel the people responsible for this movie solely banked on Mark Wahlberg's star status and shoddy effects to wow the audience.

Action was good.Now lets get into the bad.... For the first half the movie Holland's Drake is more like Peter Parker than the lead in a treasure hunt movie. Mark Wahlberg as sully is just Mark Wahlberg copy and pasting himself between movies. The movie runs the same gags like 3 times too many.... Between pickpocketing and backstabbing our heads were beaten over with the same things over and over again. Less is more! This also pertains to the villians... For a treasure hunt adventure we dont always need a villian, this is the perfect case of that. I would of rathered a main crew coming together in act 3 or act 2 than have non stop backstabs.

tt1464335,ur86707469,5,25 February 2022,"So first, I have played all of the uncharted games and I was worried about watching this film in the cinema. So the film for me was ok, I actual think Tom holland who acts as a young Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg who acts as Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan both do a good job of bring these characters to life and really making this film watchable and saved this film from the storyline as this film was for me was all over the place such as the storyline. The reason I say this is because it felt like we got half of Uncharted 3 and Uncharted 4 story in this film which did not make any sense at all. It was like the directors where just to lazy and said ok lets take some of the good parts in Uncharted 3 and Uncharted 4 and put them into this film. It does not make sense at all. For me this film should be based on uncharted 1. If you are not like me and expecting this film to be really accurate to the game, then go and watch this film. Like it is not a bad film but at the same time, this is not a good film. If you have played the game, you know the game is about Nathan finding treasure and solving puzzles and always getting beating up. So that why I liked this film as this film does gives us those moments. The scene where Nathan is hanging from the airplane is from Uncharted 3 and right at the end where he finds the treasure in the ship is from Uncharted 4.What did put me from giving this a 3/5 stars is the fact that we see mixed events from Uncharted 3 storyline and Uncharted 4 storyline. So stay and watch the end credits as you have two to watch. With the second end credit scene teasing us that Atoq Navarro could be making his appearance in future films. This film can be saved if you get a director who knows what he is doing and follow one game only, not mix two games together.

tt1464335,ur150246714,6,25 February 2022,This movie is very enjoyable and is good but it stumbles in some of the pacing choices and some of the twists were good but predictable but still a very enjoyable movie.,0,0,/user/ur150246714/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur15036413,7,13 February 2022,"Tom Holland stars as Nathan Drake in this adaptation of Naughty Dog's acclaimed video game franchise. The film more or less takes story elements from all four Uncharted games and condenses them into one movie. In this adaptation, Nate teams up with Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) and Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) on a hunt for a legendary treasure left by the Magellan Expedition where Nate hopes to uncover more about the disappearance of his brother, Sam Drake.While a fun action-adventure film with some decent casting, the movie otherwise feels like a muddled adaptation of the Uncharted franchise. Tom Holland was a good choice for Nathan Drake though the writing mostly lacks the smarmy, cocksure demeanor of Nate from the games. Likewise, Mark Wahlberg was not a bad choice for Nate's mentor, Sully, but it's mostly Wahlberg playing the same character from previous action/comedy flicks. The interaction between Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg provides some of the best comedic moments in the fil but other than that, Holland and Wahlberg don't do much to channel what made the characters from the Uncharted games so memorable and likeable. Same applies to the main antagonists in the film. Overall, the characterization feels flat and doesn't do their video game counterparts much justice.However, the film makes use of over-the-top action set pieces which is where the movie really starts to resemble the cinematic, high-flying action from the games. Other than that, whilst the movie is an average fun action flick and a good action vehicle for Tom Holland, as an adaptation it's probably a letdown for fans who hoped to see a faithful rendition of the franchise. The movie however does tease a sequel which hopefully will be a step up from this movie. - 7/10.",6,9,/user/ur15036413/?ref_=tt_urv

They are in some ways but surprisingly, it still works. And it still feels like Uncharted, which is no mean feat.It doesn't follow the games exactly but it does borrow quite a few memorable moments from them, to great effect. The final half hour was amazing. Make sure you stay for the hidden scenes in the credits!As for Tom and Mark - they have great chemistry together.

tt1464335,ur34657228,3,24 February 2022,"Nathan Drake's origin story is completely rewritten in this weird remix of Uncharted 3. Tom Holland, who could've passed off as Young Nathan is introduced to Sully while working as a bartender at an age older than Orphanage Nathan but younger than the first game. But the cargo plane scene isn't supposed to happen until Uncharted 3. The box is supposed to land in the desert not in the ocean. Why does that scene exist except to fool us into thinking there is continuity when actually there is none whatsoever? This isn't how it's supposed to be. It throws the important character development of the first and third games in the garbage. To save face, Nathan is gifted Sir Francis Drake's ring by Sam while still in the orphanage. How did Sam get it? They don't even establish that it is Sir Francis' ring so that might not be true anymore either. Sully has a cat in a backpack. What the hell? So, clearly, this isn't canon. The finale is crazy in a very Uncharted way, and that's super fun, but I was just so uncomfortable with the fact that I don't know who this Nathan Drake is. Nor do I know who Chloe is. Or Naomi who's totally absent. Or Sam who's only in flashbacks. Or Sully who doesn't grow a mustache until the ending. Or the cat who.. why is there a cat again?",3,6,/user/ur34657228/?ref_=tt_urv

I tried to like but I just couldn't suspend my disbelief on this one. At least INDIANA JONES was real when he got hit or injured.

But that doesn't mean this film alienates anyone not familiar with the Franchise in fact it does the complete opposite. I think this film acts as a perfect stepping stone for someone to get into the game series and experience the fantastic world of Uncharted. Holland's true and youthful performance of Nate's character really stands strong and I can easily see him as a younger version, definitely helped out by his athleticism during high speed- tense scenes. Wahlberg's Sully performance is also great as a younger version and he really brings the character to life with all his wisecracks and light-hearted attitude. Both carry out their respective character's behaviour and mannerisms perfectly well so I find it hard why people believe Holland was poorly casted. I understand Fillion is a fan cast choice to play Nate, but I think Holland's portrayal really deserves more praise. The overall plot was engaging and definitely didn't feel dumbed down like most modern Hollywood adaptions. I especially loved all the references sprinkled throughout such as the Auction scene and Nolan Norths' cameo appearance.

tt1464335,ur102469159,5,19 February 2022,"What made the games so fantastic was the characters and their relationships with eachother. People loved and were invested with Nate, Sully and Elena, that's why they watched. It was different than any other treasure hunting piece of mediathe movie completely lost that. They were focused more on the action that they replaced all the heart and wit that developed these characters in the game with quirky one-liners that aren't nearly as funny as in the games.It's fine as an action movie, but as an adaption it falls short. I know it was a prequel to the games but they changed almost all of when we previously knew about Nates life before the events of the first game (how/when he met sully, what happened to sam, how he got the necklace, how/when he met chloe) so why even bother making a movie adaption of the game? Just make an action movie - the cutscenes in the game are already a flawless movie when put together.I think Tom Holland did a good job, but I never really bought him as Nate. Sully was a completely different character, and their father-son dynamic doesn't appear until the last 10 minutes of the movie. I think changing the fact of Nate meeting Sully in Columbia while trying to steal Sir Francis' ring (which in the film he got from Sam ??) and saving him from Katherines goons to him just showing up at a bar saying ""i knew your brother"" (Nates a bartender and Sully is ""friends"" with Sam in the movie ??) was a huge mistake and ultimately ruined their father-son dynamic before it began.In short, it's an extremely forgettable film.

The pacing is a little tense for two hours as the director had to cut quite a lot from the game(s) to make this work. Some of the game worlds memorable moments were utilized in the dungeon dwelling/action sequences with a more or less changed form.Although Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg did quite a decent job for their parts I thought they were both about 10 to 15 years too young when compared to their counterparts in the games. Same of course applied to the female characters as they had to be written to the story keeping this in mind.Action sequences in the movie were a mixed back. They were entertaining but following today's standard in a way that cgi was sometimes used too heavily to make them look a little bit off.Without spoiling too much the director left the door to the sequel(s) which is totally understandable as there are much more material in the games to be utilized if the movie gets enough audience.This is certainly a movie worth watching if you like the games.

In Uncharted he was able to take a well known video game charterer and put him on the big screen. When a lot of people have doubts, just like me, he was able to portray him in a newer light that actually works in a full movie. The pairing of Holland and wahlberg is a pair I didn't know I needed.

It is exactly what I wanted it to be and audiences deserve more.In all reality I would give it a 7.5 simple because it wasn't ""life changing"" in the sense it wasn't artistic or provided a deep undertone or something like that.Don't get me wrong I love a good arthouse movie as much as the next guy. But in today's climate I love this more. This movie is a bid middle finger to critics. Audiences are loving it cause critics are so self absorbed they forgot how to have fun. This movie is for the every day Joe who wants to go see some fun with the family.Example, look at the Indiana Jones IMDB ratings...pretty good right? It's cause back in the day you didn't need to make a movie with some sort of ""deep commentary"", Uncharted is that.

tt1464335,ur90920733,2,17 February 2022,"I want to stress that there was good and bad in this movie, but I rated it generously. As someone who has loved and played the games I went into this movie with an open mind and if it was good but didn't feel like uncharted I wouldn't mark it down for that. Alas twas not meant to be. The plot is like so many before it, nothing original or even as good as the games. The postcard messages were made very obvious by the backstory scene.One thing I will say is that Tom Holland and Mark Whalberg are the best part of this movie, the on camera chemistry is great, but it would have made more sense if they weren't these characters and this was not under the uncharted umbrella.The next thing I want to discuss is the villain, mid-way through they scrap their villain (Antonio Banderas) for Tati Gabrielle's villain instead. I welcome this double-cross, but he character is so underdeveloped. Although she does a pretty good job in the role, the writing of her character is very poor, motivated by money (I assume) and has a mysterious relationship with sully. Also the decisions she makes are non- sensical.So the weakest points of the writing is that some of the dialogue is just awful or lazy as well as the jokes barely landing (there was one awkward chuckle I heard from a pretty silent audience). The plot is forcing every stage of development. They obviously needed things to happen so they came up with the laziest ways of doing them. He drives past the bad guys in a boat so they can follow so the end sequence can happen. The ear peices conveniently turn on and off throughout when dialogue switch between private conversations. This only scratches the surface of how lazily written this movie is.The one redeeming factor is the action. There was some cool fight scenes and action set-pieces. However the interesting camera movements and better shots in fight scenes, shows how static and boring the camera movements are in other scenes.I've could rant about this movie all day, as much as I can say I enjoyed elements of this film, it should not have existed. Sony clearly doesn't respect the fans nor the property of uncharted or they wouldn't have made this movie as poorly as they did. It is a pure cash grab. It is by no means the worst game-movie adaptation but it is a very generic action movie that is saved by short bursts of mild entertainment. I have never rolled my eyes more than in this film. I think that even when you seperate the beloved game franchise it is still a shoddily thrown together action movie that has no depth. I think that it could appeal to an audience who is just there for the actors and the action genre, but for a fan of the games and someone who expected more it wasn't fun.",7,16,/user/ur90920733/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur98025184,7,20 February 2022,"As a Huge loving fan of the games, i was just pissed of at the trailer. The trailer felt like a tribute type edit of drake's deception & A Thief's End. HOWEVER! Its actually not that bad, IF... you lower your expectations and anticipate a reboot, cause this is a reboot, because uncharted 3 already shows us the true meeting of nate and sully. This is just completely different. Overall the action, treasure hunt , the cinematography make it a movie that you just can't hate. But if you expect it to be just like the games, then you will be pretty dissapointed. Because this is a different sully and chloe. This movie is more like the 'becoming of Nathan Drake & Victor Sullivan'. The lack of usage of the uncharted music is a big letdown. I went in expecting to hate Mark walberg's sully, cause its just not sully, but even though somehow his performance appealed to me enough not to get upset. The only thing his sully and the really sully share in common is they both say kid, when referring to nate. Not even. A freaking ""GOD DAMN"" from this sully. In short its a reboot movie of how nate and sully become treasure hunters. By the end they look like nate & sully. Overall its a decent watch. But if you don't watch this in the theatre the already small impact will reduce to nothing.

tt1464335,ur108563211,8,20 February 2022,"Non-spoilersUncharted was really good, I highly encourage you go see it. It's a fun family-ish adventure that just gets you out of the house and into the tense and dangerous world of treasure hunting.The film has a great story and characters and serves as a great introduction into the dangerous world of treasure hunting.I found it captured the heart and feel of the videogames, and not to mention the characters. Some of the opening lines of the film cement who Nate is and what makes him unique. In other words a really good adaptation that allows for further development with future instalments.As per the title, this is all it needed to do.Lot's of people say it played it safe. Yes, it stuck to it's source material, but I think if it didn't create that solid of a understanding of what this story IS then it would've lost everyone.The action in this film is incredible, really fun, and, not to mention, has got the same soul as the games. It's not very violent, in terms of gunplay, but I could see later versions getting darker.The score! (final part of non-spoilers review)The score was amazing. I really loved Ramin Djawadi's score, it captures the feel of the game and expands upon it. From the bombastic highs, to the emotional character moments, the score makes you feel it all.Spoilers Ahead!How Uncharted is it, to have two ancient pirate boats be the main parts of a helicopter chase. That's so Uncharted!I really liked Sully's arc, I think that and his relationship with Nate are a great thing to set up in a prequel. On top of that, the one of the main themes of the film is trust, something extremely important when you get into the world of treasure hunting. Something I'd say the film did better than the flashbacks in the games.Nolan god-damn North. That cameo was perfect. That's all I can say, no words can describe it.The film did a great job of taking set pieces from the games and twisting it a bit. Auction scene from Uncharted 4 - now Nate doesn't get the power on. Cargo plane scene - now over the ocean. Sword fight in a burning pirate ship - now flying the ships away like El Goddamn Dorado.This film is an prequel / origin story, and I think it did a pretty good job at that.Some nit-picksI think that film should've focused a bit more on Nate's motivation being souly about his brother. Like he goes to Sully in the beginning because Sam mentions him in his postcards, not because he wants a bracelet back.There's a scene around the end of the first act that didn't need to happen. It's a scene with Antonio Banderas where he tells his father he should let the fortune go. The next time with see Antonio Banderas, he tells his father the exact same thing. Merging these scenes would be easy, but I don't know if Antonio Banderas wanted a certain amount of screen time.I found they over sexualised Nate and Chloe a bit. Nate didn't have to be shirtless, Chloe didn't need to be in a dressing gown with one shoulder down. Just want to flag, I don't know if this is me just being really shy or an actual criticism.With these remakes, the film is about a 7.7 out of 10, but it is closer to an eight than a seven. I'm making it an eight because I think that people should just go watch it, it's a lot of fun!",1,1,/user/ur108563211/?ref_=tt_urv

The action/ was amazing, I couldn't have asked for better Coreagrophy it looked so. Much like something out of the game, and I had so. Much fun watching the action, wanting to scream so much but I had to hold it in me since it was a movie theater.3. Now. Them Easter eggs, if u are a fan of the game as much as I am u will love the Easter eggs, trust me then are so cool, and I just wanted to scream a certain persons name when I watched it.4. Acting the acting was on point, from how toms Nate felt to how marks sully felt, both of them literally played their character like they where from thegames, and I addored it. Chloe was also amazing and I loved the small bits between her and Nate, it felt great, but she was the worst written out of the 3.5. Plot the plot was so much fun, this Isn't very lore friendly but it isn't trying to it feels like, it. Feels. More like they wanna write their own story in an already set universe, that doesn't really fit in there so, they had.

And I know they can't put his favorite phrase because of rating. But seriously, Sully doesn't talk much in the games.Chloe's character: We can see more indepth of her character in Lost Legacy.

I knew who's the bad guy from the start. It was not a surprise event for me.Humor: They're trying really hard to suit the current generation of humor. Probably because of how much Sully's talk in here that threw me off.Flashback (introduction of young Sam and Nate): it was not necessary at all.

As someone who essentially grew up with the game, the nostalgic factor was a really good thing which helped one up the movie. The story being a mix of all the uncharted games makes it underwhelming and hard for the audience to really click with the movie but that's expected since you can't really get the same engagement from a 30+ hour game from a movie. But, the movie tries it's best and I'd say it works in a way. Tom doesn't quite capture the essence of Nate's character but he does deliver a good performance which I have to say exceeded my expectations. Sully's character was a lot flawed in a lot of ways but Wahlberg gives his character a moment here and there which at times clicks really well.

Drake is quick on his feet in both senses, thinking fast during fight scenes in a way that allows Holland to flex his own acrobatic talents with flashes of parkour.Gorgeously realized and bolstered by amazing performances by holland(he shines as always) and Mark wahlberg , uncharted is a prescient portrait of what a great movie can come to, and we needs these adventure movies back in our modern days.Great movie and a must watch for fans of adventure and trillers.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur149829957/?ref_=tt_urv

Now, I've been looking forward to a movie based on a video game series that I'm a fan of for quite some time, but the trailers and news about this movie led me to believe that this movie was going to be really bad, especially when I found out who was going to play Nathan Drake and who was playing Victor Sullivan (Sully).That is definitely the worst part about this film - the cast. Tom Holland does a great job playing a teenage super-hero and he's a solid actor overall, but when I was watching this movie, his performance didn't really make me think he was the right person for this role. The same goes for Mark Wahlberg. The man brings nothing new to the table with his performances. No effort was put into the performances to make it seem as though we're watching two beloved characters that we have been following for a long time.This movie is written in such a way that it doesn't feel like the people involved really liked the ""Uncharted"" games. There are some notable details here and there, like Sully getting his mustache at the end, but that's not what made the Uncharted games so great. People love the story, the characters and their relationships in those games. This movie doesn't respect that love. It doesn't understand what made those games good.Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg have no chemistry whatsoever and their characters have no charisma. So when they become friends at the end, it doesn't feel earned. There's no substance, no love for the source material, nothing. If you are going to make a movie about a beloved video game franchise, shouldn't you at least be concerned about making it faithful to the source material?As for the rest, what can I say? The cinematography and shot composition are bland, the editing is bad and the dialogue is really cringe-worthy at parts. There are some unintentionally funny moments, like the part where Nathan Drake gets knocked out of the airplane, despite seeing the car heading towards him for a few seconds. Or the part where the evil woman, Braddock, falls off the ship after being hit by a bag full of gold. That was hilarious. There's also a scene where Antonio Banderas's character gets his throat slit and the movie doesn't show blood coming out. Sure, the ""Uncharted"" games weren't very violent or bloody, but this is just ridiculous.Anyway, this movie is an embarrassment to ""Uncharted"" fans and moviegoers... it's soulless, poorly written and boringly shot. It's a real shame, because this movie had potential, but unfortunately, that potential was squandered and what we're left with at the end of the day is a movie that suffers from terrible directing, an awful script and downright embarrassing casting choices.3/10.",3,6,/user/ur41693290/?ref_=tt_urv

I never wanted a shot for shot remake of the games, so thank goodness they steered away from that pitfall. Still, there were plenty of fun callbacks to the games sprinkled throughout.There have been many who were unhappy that the movie was cast to appeal to a demographic that wasn't specifically them, but Tom Holland did a fantastic job with the material he was given and shows that he can easily keep up with the physicality and charm required in an action lead. He is his own Nate and that's great. Mark Wahlberg as Sully, on the other hand, is a little flat, especially in the timing of his quips. This results in the jokes not landing as well as they might have. That said, Mark Wahlberg has always had his own brand of charisma which he still brings to the table. Tati Gabrielle and Antonio Banderas made fine villains but the PG-13 rating was too limiting and left everything too bloodless and sanitized.The meeting of Nate and Sully lacks creativity and is filled with clunky expositional dialogue and the setup and payoff of the lighter seemed overdone and disappointingly pointless but, while the adventure is underway, the movie finds its flow, its problems are more easily overlooked, and it remains solid fun throughout because the puzzles, set pieces and fights that one would expect from Uncharted are all excellent.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur6537820/?ref_=tt_urv

However, I think one has to be an 'Uncharted' gamer on an almost religious level to find the film adaptation adequate.The movie is always worse than the game
I have not played 'Uncharted' myself, it must be said, but completed both the 'Hitman', 'Max Payne' and 'Tomb Raider' games without caring in the least about the film adaptations.As you know, it is almost impossible to name a game film that beats the original. 'Uncharted' confirms that rule.Even though it is a so-called prequel, a precursor to the story in the game, which by its very nature establishes the game's original characters, while the rest of the action most resembles a copy of well-known treasure hunter films.Indiana Jones would sigh and go out.There is a lot of nailing from the 'National Treasure' movies (with Nicholas Cage), but unfortunately 'Uncharted' is an even more self-absorbed cousin. Even Indiana Jones would sigh and go out.Not even the two otherwise charming protagonists, Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland (him from 'Spider-Man'), take themselves seriously, but look like two acrobatic lunatics lost in a B-movie.In short: Sony is making a big movie to sell more playstation games.

One principal element that I felt like was missing though was violence. This film was pretty tame in that department except maybe the cutthroat scene.Tom Holland was surprisingly good in this role, but I still think they should have chosen someone else. And I don't care about that he doesn't look like Nathan. I mean that Holland's presence is nothing like Nathan's. Other roles were cast very well.The biggest mistake of this film was how they killed off Banderas' character for no reason at all. What a waste of a great actor and all that good groundwork they did for this villain to make us feel intimidated by him.Overall I enjoyed this film and think it was the best video game adaptation (film format: if we consider tv-series too, then the Witcher is the best) that I have seen.

tt1464335,ur127522320,4,19 February 2022,What a strange concept... Creating a movie that's based off of a game that's already so heavily inspired by action/adventure movies. It's existence is especially unnecessary because it doesn't really do anything different to justify itself. What this movie attempts to do has already been done to death *and so much better* by its contemporaries and predecessors.If you haven't played the video games and really enjoy the genre: You might find a few entertaining moments. But there's nothing new brought to the table here. It's mediocre at best.If you HAVE played the video games (like I have): I say don't waste your time. You're already experiencing the best version of the story in the best way possible.It's certainly not the worst movie I've seen... it's just so painfully average compared to the stunning source material...,2,5,/user/ur127522320/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur127929369,7,15 February 2022,"As a huge fan of the game franchise I was equally excited and terrified, because of this I fully expected to leave the cinema disappointed. Instead what I got was the Uncharted film I had hoped for, light, funny, ridiculous action set pieces, enjoyable characters and an interesting wee bit of history.Understanding that this is an origin story is important for any long term fans and this film purposely uses it's runtime to slowly build Tom Holland and Mark Walberg into Nate and Sully. It incrementally introduces iconic elements of the characters as it goes on and does a great job of doing so.Tom Holland constantly surprises me, especially here, he manages to do justice to such a great character which I was very sceptical of. Sophia Ali is perfect as Chloe Frazer and their relationship is brilliantly adapted. Antonio Banderas and Tati Gabriella do really well as the villains taking lots of elements from A Thief's End. Unfortunately Mark 'the brick' Walberg kind of lets the cast down as he seems to forget to act (again) but it's not so bad as the script carries him through, although I could of done with a 'God Damn"" somewhere.Adapting a game to a film is difficult as a game allows you much more time to tell the story but the pacing was pretty spot on, even the structure was closely taken from the source. There were also enough references and Easter eggs to keep my geeky little brain happy.My only real bug bare was the music, for some reason they decided to add a commercial soundtrack throughout even though they had a brilliant composer like Ramin Djawadi. The moments when you finally get the original theme are very enjoyable.Uncharted left me really excited to see the what they do and where they go with the sequel and made me want to play through the games allover again.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur127929369/?ref_=tt_urv

I feel that sums it up, I can't imagine watching this film seriously. It's soft comedy and easy, quickly fulfilled suspense made this a very enjoyable film. As long as you do not look to much into the details of what is realistic and what is not. The film is scattered with many unrealistic qualities, that raise many questions however once you let go of the idea of reality and allow the suspension of disbelief to take over. The film becomes a wonderful fun adventure.The cast seemed well suited, no one felt out of place which was something of a relief for this style of film. The cast had a good sense of chemistry that allowed the film to flow and the characters to stay interesting. I do understand many were disappointed with the casting of Tom Holland as Nate, due to his young look and very Peter Parker esque portrayal of the character, however I do not think the film is one that is meant to be of homage to the game, it plays the story down In a soft consumable way, making it difficult for any die hard fan to be pleased with the portrayal of the story. On that front it makes this movie difficult to justify as it felt like more of an action comedy than action adventure.The film also has a very predictable plot, it follows that of a comedy action narrative extremely well, which would be great if that was what the film was marketed it to be.

It was a fun little adventure but what excites me the most is all the room this story has to expand. Obviously this is based off a large and successful video game series, but it can go in a bit of a different direction than the games. On its own this film is a fun watch, unfortunately it seems that those who wanted it to coincide with the video games perfectly were disappointed and therefore left lower reviews than the film deserved.

tt1464335,ur150023968,3,18 February 2022,"SPOILERS!If this was meant to be a film to begin a saga, they totally missunderstand the game.It's clear to me the producers and the actors (exception of Holland maybe) are NOT fans of the saga.Here is my explanation.Actors: None of them plays the part like their characters in the game. People in charge of the cast should retire for good.Holland is not Drake but after 1 hour of the movie you tend to beleive his role.Mark is no even close to be Sully and is sad because he is such a key character in Uncharted. Seems he is tired of acting at all. Sully should have been older!Sophia Ali doesn't have the charm and definitely is not the sex bomb Chloe is. Her performance is only average.Antonio Banderas is superb as a villain, but when we finally get to see his climax, inexplicably they decided to kill him. No one understood why.His replacement as a villain, Tati, is not even close. They don't explain her truly contribution to the movie because there is never a role construction during the movie. Is like they killed the bad guy in Terminator 2 (T1000), and replaced it with the friend of john connor riding the bike. Is totally inexcusable. I'm still dissapointed about this.Script: Why they decided to change something superb that works for something it doesn't. The never take the time to explain in dept. What we apreciated with the games is that we get to learn about history and here is something that happens so fast like the action scenes. They have to take the time to talk more about history, characters, locations like in the game. They made up a history that never conviced me.Cinematography: They spent all the budget on the plane and ship scenes, and the rest seems cheap like the goonies. CG is okay not great.Action scenes: why they never show blood? Why they wanted to do a PG-13 movie? This was intended to have real action like a Bourne secuence at least, but feels like a Disney made movie for little children. Guns factor is key on Uncharted and It never felt accordingly. They never understood real fans of Uncharted are now +25 at least if not 30. First game was released 15 years ago!Fun factor: The movie keeps you on the edge most of the time. Is good for a while but you don't want that all the time. And why they have to throw a punchline for a quick laugh like a Marvel movie syndrome?Conclusions: They wanted to make the new Indiana Jones for the family but they ended making Legends of the hidden temple program in Nickelodeon with a bit of Pirates of the Caribbean but low budget. With actors and producers never care a bit of a legendary games saga.",0,2,/user/ur150023968/?ref_=tt_urv
tt1464335,ur150024411,2,18 February 2022,"In many ways, criticizing a film is easy. We risk very little, yet we still enjoy criticizing and evaluate those who submit their work and offer to be judged.As a critic, I can only say that, in fact, even the most disastrous films are probably more significant than what I admit in my reviews.Today, I can say that I find myself in the unusual position where my review is certainly better, and more appreciable, than the movie Uncharted.I'll start by comparing the movie to the games. In fact, I don't think I need to, since they have nothing to do with each other. The name of the movie is the same, the names of the characters are the same, and in the end, the objective is the same: solving puzzles to find the treasure.We have a naive Nathan Drake, a greedy and opportunistic Sully, a traitorous Clhoe, and a villain who dies stupidly and unnecessarily in the middle of the movie, with a neck wound that didn't even bleed, and that looked more like a scratch.These were the characters in the film, totally out of character and out of place, with meaningless and completely useless scenes, and who were arguably more concerned with betraying each other than pursuing a common goal.However, a Nathan Drake barista, who lives in Boston, certainly wins the award for the biggest idiocy.The historical context of the film was bad. I was disappointed by the enormous discredit given to Fernão de Magalhães. It was never mentioned that he was portuguese, and it was never spoken of his country, Portugal, the leading naval power of the discoveries. I think it was necessary.The great strength of this film was undoubtedly the ""Tom Holland marketing"", who I believe that if he hadn't participated in it, even fewer people would have wanted to see the film.Thanks to Columbia Pictures and Playsation for creating parallel universes where they weren't needed. This movie will only mess with the heads of those who haven't played the games yet, or those who played the games and haven't seen the movie yet.A mediocre film that certainly could have been much better, and that could have continued a spectacular series of films, turned out to be nothing more than 2 hours of pure frustration, which are not worth more than 2 stars.In my opinion, as a critic, there will only remain one Uncharted story. In the future, if I still remember this movie, it will just be like a shoddy cheap imitation of the video game series I had the privilege of playing.Bad acting and cast, terrible production, deplorable plot. I was terribly disappointed. The next ones I won't see.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur150024411/?ref_=tt_urv

It delivered the kind of pulpy adventure like the serials the series and it's other inspirations were based on. Tom Holland's Nate isn't the Nate of the games but he was terrific. Wahlberg's Sully wasn't the Sully of the games but it was a very refreshing role for him. Sophia Ali & Tati Gabrielle were amazing as well.

I wanted it to be the perfect movie, I wanted the video game lovers to love the movie and those who haven't played the game - go get the motivation to go. Admittedly on the day, I accepted maybe it wasn't going to be great, but at least it would be a good action flick.Well boy did they prove me wrong. It was everything I didn't even know I wanted. They did a wonderful job of merging the game franchise where it made perfect sense for the movie - where the information wasn't overwhelming and made perfect sense for casual movie goers.Tom Holland was amazing as Nathan Drake. I don't know why I doubted him. Every single time I think maybe he won't suit a role - he blows it out of the water and proves me wrong. This man was born to act, and he is tremendous.Also with Mark Wahlberg he is not even half of what I pictured for Sully when they announced his casting, but he was wonderful. He was a great introduction to his character and they did wonderful character building. Plus the chemistry between Mark and Tom was fantastic.I really adored this movie. The action was super fun, the dialogue was the perfect amount of corny (just like the games). I really hope more people see this movie and appreciate it for what it was. It's fantastic.

tt1464335,ur150061688,8,19 February 2022,"Unlike most video game movie adaptations, Uncharted is quite refreshing and shows us the origin of the lovely story that is Nathan Drake.Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, while not fan-favorite choices, do a good job of embodying the spirit and banter of the franchise's two main characters, Nathan ""Nate"" Drake and Victor ""Sully"" ""Goddamn"" Sullivan.Uncharted is a clear service to longtime fans of the series. Taking huge inspiration from the games in one of the Uncharted series most iconic scenes. A sense of adventure along with large-scale, over-the-top, well-choreographed action sequences that some may find obnoxious but are reminiscent of their video game counterpart. A couple of emotional and goosebump-inducing callbacks to the video games including an amazing nostalgic scene with the original voice actor of Nate, Nolan North. A nod to Greg Edmonson's ""Nate's Theme"" as Tom Holland's Drake dons the iconic gun holsters. All this while also bringing a new enjoyable interpretation for newcomers to the series.While there may be some corny jokes, forgettable villains, and questionable casting choices, how director Ruben Fleischer managed to encapsulate some but not all of Uncharted's glory into this 1 h 56-minute movie deserves some recognition. While it cannot compare to the G. O. A.

After bringing the boats out they start to head towards a another ship in the ocean where the antagonist is watching from.

We also didn't get to see her often at the end which is a shame imoI am aware of the Uncharted games and I think Tom Holland isn't suitable to be Nathan Drake as he wasn't humorous as Nathan was in the games.Overall I think it's a good movie worth a watch, for me it was an average experience.",1,2,/user/ur150075111/?ref_=tt_urv

What a waste of 2 hours. Such a masterpiece of a game, dealt in the horrible hands of studio executives who DO NOT understand the spirit of the game or what it stood for. Why is everyone promoting Tom Holland like he's some wonder child!? He clearly doesn't know acting or any gist of what cinema is. Neither anyone involved in the film understood what the video game series was actually about. They made a movie for kids based on a game that was made for adults, by adults. Seriously, stop making movies. Hollywood or Bollywood, learn from Tollywood or Kollywood or Mollywood on at least how to write scripts and watchable stories. CGI doesn't mean a thing when you have a mish-mash of bull in the name of story, acting, cinematography, screenplay, music, plot, production values and most importantly, direction. Film making and cinema is DEAD! Give me a budget and a studio, see what wonder I WILL create to dedicate towards cinema.In the name of set pieces, the movie takes vandalism in a Papa John's store, with no consequences. Some watery places, rock islands, some pubs, bars, a prison and rooms. Finished! That's 'Uncharted' for you! So grand, isn't it!? (Pun Intended) Forget all the giant locales and sceneries to be 'explored' by the protagonist. Not one actor was in the character defined by the game, all set pieces lifted off from minuscule parts of the game, not head or tail of the story, fake acting and forced emotional innuendos, story so forgettable and predictable that you'll forget it the moment you walk out of the cinema hall, convenient plot choices, laziest writing, dull/absent sense of humour, even some of the action moments were copied in from the game. Is originality dead!? Yes, this movie is the prime and shining example of the same. Yet, it shall be saved on ratings by executives who'd create dummy accounts and applaud the movie for they'd get paid to do so. That'd propel more people to watch it in cinemas, rack up the BO collections and declare it a hit in Tom Holland's name of fame.What's with this wonder child of Hollywood- Tom Holland!? That schmuck doesn't even know how to be in a role, plays always in the same ball-game for any role he's given. Better go back to school and finish your acting course first and then learn from the big daddys on how to 'act'. Still, there are people to back him up and buy awards for him, give him more and more movies for god-knows-why nepotism prolly which is hidden away.This movie should've never happened.

tt1464335,ur150086760,2,20 February 2022,I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. In a 2 hour movie based on the bombastic action games Uncharted (which are awesome) this movie has no action and is very boring throughout. I found myself falling asleep in the theater wondering what was going on the entire time. The plane scene and ship scenes last a total of 5 minutes. Many plot holes and terrible casting choices. When you sit through this movie you can very much tell that they just wanted Tom Holland to bring in as much money as they could. There is no love of the original games here and in fact changes many aspects of the games. And the absolute horrible Nolan North cameo (the original voice actor for Nathan). A constant backstabbing and double crossing makes this a boring Indiana Jones wannabe. My take is go watch the 1999 film The Mummy which is the closest to Uncharted and far more enjoyable and fun.2/10-Save your money.,0,3,/user/ur150086760/?ref_=tt_urv

tt1464335,ur150140012,9,21 February 2022,"TLDR: Best Video Game movie ever. As a fan of series, I really enjoyed it. Don't listen to critics and reviews, if you feel at all like seeing it, give it a chance and form your own opinion.I have seen a lot of negativity towards this movie, but as a huge fan of the game series I can confirm that atleast in my opinion and in the opinion of my GF who is also a fan of the series this movie was really good. I'd say best Video game movie ever made.The movie is it's own thing to an extent, that is what I want to say from the beginning. It does not require you to have played the games nor follow exact storylines from the games. It takes inspiration and scenes from the game and has enough in common with the games with its cool nods to the franchise but in the end is it's own thing and does it well. And if you can look past that I think you'll enjoy this like I did.So elephant in the room is the Cast. I'll just come out and say that I think Tom and Mark pulled it off. I was skeptical as everyone at first, but they won me over and the chemistry really worked. I really liked Tom's portrayal even tho it is different than Nolan's original. It is more boyish in parts but taps in to the humor and charm of original. And that works as Tom is here playing younger Drake as in Drake before the games. And Mark also can pull his own as Sully and they work well together. Same also goes for rest of the cast. Chloe's actor is good and also fit's to the role. She brings some good banter and twists to the relationship of the trio (Nathan, Sully, Chloe). Again somewhat different than the original portrayal in the games but still work IMO.I can admit without spoiling that twist with the villain, I wasn't fan of. I really liked the actor who seemed to be the main villain but in the end wasn't and would've liked to see more done with it. But still the twist didn't ruin anything like some reviews have claimed.The movie also had lot of action and it was well made for most part. There was humor in combat and good choreography in the action. Also the CGI was good for most part so there actually was some money spend on this movie. There was lot of humor, wise cracks and nice Easter eggs that made my and my GF chuckle. So of course knowing Uncharted and NaughtyDogs other work will give you a better appreciation of the movie, but you can definitely see it regardless of your familiarity with the series.Overall this review is already a novel so I'd say don't listen to the critics and many reviewers out there. If you feel at all intrigued, go watch it and form your own opinion. This movie does deserve some love because I atleast am really glad that there finally is actually good video game movie. It won't win any oscars that is for sure, but as it stands it was an enjoyable watch and I hope enough people watch it that we get a sequel that may or may not have been hinted at some point.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur150140012/?ref_=tt_urv

tt1464335,ur32462108,8,18 February 2022,"So, I'm not saying this movie was a masterpiece or anything. It's really just a nice popcorn action movie, and a pretty good interpretation of the Uncharted stories, which I felt, really captured the spirit and the vibes of the game series, even though it's not exactly like the games.Cons:I definitely had some problems with it. The one I keep hearing from everybody is Mark Wahlberg as Sully. To be completely honest, I don't think he's the best Sully, or much like the character from the games at all. But after about halfway through the movie, I really enjoyed his comedic chemistry with Tom Holland and didn't mind so much about his inclusion, since what's really important in an Uncharted movie is how the characters are able to interact with one another in entertaining ways. This movie totally has that.There were definitely some noticeable green screen moments too, especially when characters are being backlit by daylight. It's noticeable if you've seen a lot of action movies. The Papa John's sponsorship thing. It was just one little line, but it was noticeable. Didn't take me out of the movie that much, but it was there. At least it wasn't as bad as that Bud light sponsorship in that other Mark Wahlberg action movie (jesus christ Transformers 4 sucked).If you've seen some Indiana Jones adventure type plots in the past, you're probably going to able to predict whats going to happen much of the time. It's not bad if you enjoy those things, but there's something to be said for a movie's ability to surprise you, and this one isn't going to blow anybody away with it's plot structure.But that's about it for the cons for me.Uncharted is a popcorn entertainment series of games. Nothing super deep, just bombastic action with some spicy quippy lines between characters in between, throw in a little climbing and shooting and you got yourself an Uncharted experience. And this movie delivered on what I think Uncharted feels like, and that's quite an accomplishment. It really feels like Uncharted. There's a lot of fan service too if you're in it for that, and I think it was tastefully done for the most part.I'm sure a lot of the negative reception for this movie is going to be centered around how ""it's not like the games"". So, I think the games are brilliant, but it doesn't mean that those games are going to translate well to a 2 hour movie. In each game, you have 8-14 hours to get to know each character, and in 2 hours you need a script that can fit introductions, character arcs, and plot information. That's hard to do. But despite my worries about this movie falling apart at multiple levels, I found the writing to be pretty well done. Not anything groundbreaking or entirely new, but I felt like Tom Holland did an excellent job portraying a young adult Nathan Drake. I don't think anyone can say he did a bad job in this movie. I felt like he understood what made Drake work, and he has the charm and athleticism to sell this character to the audience. I liked his development with Sam, it's easy to understand, and a good motivator for him to enter the world of thieves. He really does feel like the hero by the end of this movie.The actress for Chloe did a well enough job for her role as the renegade thief love interest for Nate, and although I wish we had a gotten a little more time to flesh her out, she served her purpose and I bought her dynamic with the rest of the cast.Antonio Banderas did a good job portraying our typical action-movie-rich-guy-obsessed-with-treasure villain, even though it felt like he could've been on screen a bit more and had more interaction with the main cast.Hell even Tati Gabrielle did a good job as Braddock, the femme fatale to fear. I felt when she was on screen, she had the dont-mess-with-me-energy you want from a character like this.The setpieces are largely taken from the games, but I thought the original action setpieces were also real highlights. Some of these sequences would fit right in the games, especially the final action sequence. It's all totally ridiculous, but if you've seen action movies before (or if you've played the games), this is nothing new. It's just there for entertainment, and I found it very entertaining. The physical combat was really great too. Major props to all the stuntwork performed in this movie. Physical combat scenes in movies are so often boring and cookie cutter, but they mixed it up well. The environment is used so well here. Tom Holland is frequently using his wits and what's around him to win fights, which is so much more engaging than just 'hit a bunch of guys hard'. That scene where he has to take out the guy in the bar comes to mind, and the sequence with the ship. It's been said before but Tom Holland really shines in acrobatic action scenes. Not too much shaky cam on the action either! Nicely framed and easy to follow.I don't wanna rant too long, but yeah I just had a great time watching this movie. I think I'd give it an 8/10. It could go down to a 7 over time or on a second watch. I'll go ahead and say it's one of, if not the best, video game movies I've seen. I would not recommend this movie to anybody who doesn't enjoy action flicks, or movies without really fleshed out characters.

Tom Holland plays Peter Parker in an alternate universe where he works as a bartender and a pick pocket, and without the superpowers. Mark Wahlberg plays Mark Wahlberg (shocking!). Even the original characters aren't really ""original"". Meaning, Antonio Banderas plays a stereotypical villain who's trying to get the treasure ""prove himself"". Tati Gabrielle's ""Braddock"" notably resembles Nadine Ross from Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy.

Also, moncada death scene (the villain) was so cheap, the girl cuts his throat but only a few drops of blood come out?

tt1464335,ur51051069,8,20 February 2022,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Uncharted games and I have to say, I really enjoyed Tom Holland's Uncharted movie. I see it as a prequel of sorts that sets up the character relationships in contrast to the game versions. In this film, we see the formation of relationships that the games introduced as years long and pre-developed. Basically they decided to hit the reset button on this IP and set it apart from the game series. I think this was a smart move. Sony is establishing right away this is its own Uncharted story with its own history inspired by the Nathan Drake of the game series. In my opinion, they nailed it. That being said, Mark Wahlberg absolutely invoked a young Sully throughout the movie. In the film, he has yet to be warmed by his attachment to Nate. The games primarily showed us a version of the character who spent years mentoring Nate on their treasure hunting adventures. The film gives us a version of Sully only briefly touched on in the games through flashback sequences. Here he clearly has a heart, but it is buried beneath his lust for riches at any cost. The potential for character growth is very apparent to someone who had played the games. Of course, Tom Holland also stood out and did a wonderful job as a young version of Nathan Drake. Here he has only begun his adventures, and that's an important distinction from his game counterpart. Again, this version also seamlessly lines up with the younger Nate glimpsed in game flashbacks. We have yet to see him become the same confident and fearless Nathan Drake from the first Uncharted game. I'm sure that Holland is capable of showing us a complex evolution for this character as he encounters more dangers that draw out the hero within. The burning question I am left with after the film is this: Now that we have established the characters, their motivations and relationships to each other, will we see more stories that steer deeper into the supernatural elements of the games? Let's hope we get another movie to find out. I highly recommend fans of the game series check this adaption out, but don't feel like this movie isn't for you if you've never heard of Uncharted before. I give it a solid 8/10.

tt1464335,ur53581453,8,11 February 2022,"Whenever you take on the daunting challenge of adapting a video game franchise for the cinema, you face an uphill battle from the outset.But adapting a video game franchise that happens to be one of the most successful and most fiercely adored out there is a task many in the industry will wince at.After years of speculation and setbacks, on a road that includes a terrific, albeit incomplete, fan film project, UNCHARTED finally makes its way onto the big screen with massive expectations and an abundance of fans ready to burn it at the stake if it so much as gets Sully's facial features wrong.So, does it succeed?That's a complicated question to answer fairly.Ruben Fleischer's UNCHARTED is a film that, much like Tom Holland's young Nathan Drake in the opening sequence, hangs in the balance. It isn't quite the natural successor to the Nathan Fillion-starring short film from 2018 and will likely leave many die-hard fans of the franchise feeling frustrated with its characterisation and plot. It also isn't quite the buddy action comedy by commitee that modern Hollywood has churned out in various incarnations. UNCHARTED manages to find the smallest of spaces in between these two descriptions -
while the fan film had the genuine cinematic fingerprints of the video games, this feature film substitutes those qualities for a deeper focus on comedy and chemistry and largely succeeds in that regard; however, it lacks the sheer thrills and carefully crafted plot points of the games in favour of predictable story beats and a glossy, stylish exterior fit for the 2020s.But that's not to say UNCHARTED isn't exciting or even daring. It showcases its highlights with the best aspect of the games themselves - the action setpieces.The choreography is frequently spectacular and is pulled off with genuine flair while the globetrotting locations are used to its advantage by being able to display a variety of indoor areas and outside terrain.The performances are perhaps what stand out the most though - the chemistry between Holland and Wahlberg is fresh and organic and they really anchor the film and drive the plot forward with tenacity. Their relationship and character arcs are believable and help lay the foundation for the partnership Drake and Sully would eventually form in the games.The comedy is actually pretty well written and plays to each of the actors' strengths but the overall pacing of the film can feel cluttered and awkward, especially with Antonio Banderas' crew, as the conflict and set-up between our heroes and villains can feel slightly disjointed.The glaring issue here is it's glossy and stylish to a fault; the raw, gritty essence of Nolan North's tenure is watered down in order to make way for a movie star-led action-adventure that see-saws between a buddy comedy and an old-school treasure hunt. UNCHARTED is Sony's latest to exhibit what can happen by trying to please too many demographics; you slowly but surely lose the soul of the story you're meant to be telling.Maybe the entire idea of telling the story of a young Nathan Drake just doesn't work and that Sony should've focused on adapting A Thief's End instead.The cynic in me reminds you that the inevitable sequel(s?) wouldn't have been possible if that route had been chosen.Ultimately, the fan film is more successful in transporting the suspense, pathos and texture of the game franchise than its big screen counterpart but Holland and Wahlberg's partnership as well as the action setpieces help lift this film to respectable heights, hopefully opening this world up to a new generation of fans.The answer to my initial question, does it succeed? Yes, in many ways, just not in the way you want it to.-I love old-school adventure films and i'm glad I supported this one as we desperately need more of them even if they stem from existing intellectual property.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur53581453/?ref_=tt_urv

I thought both Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg did fantastic recreating Nate and Sully, even though I still believe they aren't the best fits for the role, they still showed the series the love it deserves with their performances. Parts of the story seemed rushed and not very thought out, the movie takes a more so unrealistic approach than the games ever do. One thing I don't understand is the plot seems to mostly be based on the 4th game entry, yet all the plot points are completely different.

tt1464335,ur89598490,4,21 February 2022,"THE CURSE OF GAME ADAPTATIONS CONTINUESI had trouble watching, it as my eyes kept rolling as a severe reaction to the acute writing laziness.For movie standards, It's an okay reel to watch, if you are part of a mindless adventure fanbase that also missed out on playing more than one hundred hours of epic well written storytelling in another medium. The movie completely disregarded the original story and didn't even bother making a backstory for one villain, and made a flimsy one for the other. Original Sully had a mustache (even early on), had an appetite for cigars, a deep charismatic voice along with its accent and intonation, and a gallantly and captivating attitude. None of those were portrayed in the movie. Walhberg just played a greedy, dumb, high-pitched, superficial Walhberg. Tom is funny enough, but far from the hardened, self-raised, orfan Drake. Fillion or Nolan would have made a better fit. Chloe was well cast though, just poorly written - and a skirt? Really? Felt off. A ""Chloe Frazer"" google search would suffice for wardrobe choices.Dialogue tried to be funny, but most times ended up being dull with zero subtext or tension. Aside from the final wrap-up redemption scenes, zero chemistry between the main characters.Since that early on was established that physics just doesn't apply and consequences are non-existent, no stakes were given in the making of this movie. It so disregards the original stories that they didn't even bother explaining on HOW a pair of 2.000-ton galleons ended up in a cave in which the entry barely fit the 20ft motorboat. Location-wise, New York is just an odd choice for a character who praised the outdoors and history. And a Papa Johns, in Barcelona - Europe? Wouldn't it be a Bodega or something more true to the very thing that motivates the characters, story, and fans? One would barely notice the americanization of every damn thing. The producer's segmentation of the Uncharted fanbase was downright stereotypical stupid and it would be the only thing (other than cash) that would justify casting a teenager Spiderman and a one roled-Whalberg instead of more fitting actors that hat would better serve the story.

The action and humor throughout keep it entertaining.The film manages to capture the essence of the games without feeling like a carbon copy, which was the correct way to go.

I was so into it that I can't pick one just thing as my favorite about this show. The action, the character development, the emotional moments, the score, the animation or be it just the writing in general, Demon Slayer is on a whole different level. I went through a number of emotions watching it, and it felt like I was on one wild ride from episode 1 to 26. The mood keeps varying from time to time, but the tempo never drops and with intriguing characters, it only gets better and better with every episode.Demon Slayer keeps shifting focus to different supporting characters, thus making you feel as if you're yourself a part of the protagonist Tanjiro's journey: one filled with tons of mind-blowing, jaw-dropping action sequences. There were a number of moments where my mind was blown away! Amidst all the violence and tension, the sweet brother-sister relationship of Tanjiro and Nezuko tugs at your heartstrings. While Tanjiro is the usual memorable and relatable ""shonen"" protagonist, other characters are surprisingly also treated very well. Be it the cute Nezuko, the tough yet hilarious Inosuke, or the comic relief yet strongly written Zenitsu, the show is full of characters that will end up growing on you.The animation is literally breathtaking. Several action scenes feel like actually filmed with a camera than drawn by hand, which is stupendous! The score is another major positive, elevating the show's epic scale and tone to unexpected levels. Although it's not a comedy, the funny bits involving the three boys are a major highlight, especially in the last few episodes. Some might find its quickly shifting focus from one set of supporting characters to another a little uneven, but the writing is so strong you don't get time to think anything else, with constant action delivered in every episode.I am normally left blank when I finish watching an anime show, but that's not what happened here. I was instead happy that it was perfectly concluded and it left me excited for the box-office blockbuster sequel film, which I clearly can't wait to watch now.

tt9335498,ur129636274,8,23 July 2021,"Season 1: The animation is beautiful very colorful and artistic many of the characters have very vivid color schemes that makes them stand out from each other. The backgrounds are stunning as well how much of the landscapes have detail put it into them even from far away shots. The action is fast pace and energetic as with a alot of anime. However still offers a unique style from the mixture between hand drawn with CG and other FX effects. How the camera angle are positioned, the visuals of the breathing techniques. Once again the art style having a traditional Japanese style with hint of the modern age given that this takes place between the 1910s-1920s. The music is creative not that much looping or replay of the same tracks. Characters for the most part all have distinct personalities not all the same generic copy and paste character, some do share kind of similarities to those you've seen before in another anime/Manga. Their personalities are still unique that they still have their own identity. Tanjiro interesting given the fact that he joins to slay demons and cure his sister. However at the same time he does feel sympathy for a lot of demons realizing that many were human before some suffering he's not a cold callous killer. It's also nice that there's sort of a equality balance between him and Nezuko. It's not like every single fight Tanjiro always wins or his sister always has to save him and vice versa. Sometimes their opponents that he can't defeat, she can't beat and that someone else has to. There both the main character with vulnerability and while Nezuko doesn't really speak she's adorable and the expressions with eyes and gestures tells how she feel when she need to communicate. You feel the bond between them is strong. Inosuke is a lone thickhead with a boar head who always run head first into battle wanting to fight everyone he come across, easily manipulable he one a the funniest characters hands down. Zenitsu is that character very common in some many anime he's over the top, loud always scared&crying, sweet on women. Even though he can clearly fight he would prefer not to. He Similar to Usopp from one piece pre-timeskip dialed to like 10 he's to much to the point he's the most annoying and least active of the group. However there's something more to him than just what's on the surface. He's a very split character either you'll love him or hate him. Overall this a great jump into the only thing is that it doesn't end big the last five episode seems like they could've been two not much happens.The Entertainment District arc: Following the events of the Mugen Train and the death of Kyojuro everybody returns to butterfly mansion to mourn and recover. Overtime the mansion get a visit from the sound Haishira Tengen Uzui, Who's looking for some extra arms to accommodate him to the Tokyo Entertainment District. Where many women have being mysteriously disappearing including Tengens wives who we're sent in to uncover what's going on. Now everyone sets out to find his wife and put a stop to the upper number responsible. If the action was your favorite highlight of this show then this arc double . Not only does the animation once more looks stunning, it's been stepped up even more since the previous season. More artistic styles more visual colors and just bold smooth movements the visuals this season is just a spectacle to look at artistically and technically. The overall arc itself doesn't really feel long it's paced just enough that it covers all the essentials of the plot without feeling constricted or stretched out. There's a perfect balance between the characters. All with a epic and heartfelt conclusion full with tons of over the top action,gore, blood and destruction magnificent. When it comes to the characters the gang themselves they don't change all that much personality wise. The comedy between Inosuke and Zenitsu when they go undercover is funny. Tanjiro has his moments between himself thinking of Nezuko once more the relationship between them does not disappoint. Having read the manga Tengen while I wouldn't say he's my favorite Hashira I did like his character and design as sort of this very loud flashy flamboyant Shinobi. Whose sort of a player with his three Wives who also get some funny lines and moments. The Entertainment district arc is just an overall spectacle.

Quite aside from their taste for human flesh, they are often insanely strong, and can regenerate lost body parts- even a whole body, in time. Only beheading by the Slayer's nichirin swords, or sunlight, can kill them. (One Slayer, we learn, HAS found a third way to do the job, though.) Some of the demons also practice Blood Demon Arts- demon magic- while the Slayers have nothing to oppose that except their swords, their skills, their wits, and their resolve. Most of the demons have come to relish their own horrible table manners (and crude jokes, though the humans don't manage better in the humor department-more later); but some were people made into demons very much against their will (much like the vampires in Shiki), and retain some of their memories of their former human existence. Tanjiro certainly has a personal reason to understand this, and it gives him a nuanced view of his opponents that will turn out to be absent in some other Slayers. We'll in fact get the backstories of some of the demons, which make them almost pathetic creatures. But one who deserves NO sympathy, who can NEVER be forgiven, is their own ""final boss"", the perpetrator of misery to both humans AND the demons under his command, the Sauron/Voldemort of the demon world, named Muzan Kibutsuji. But it's the defeat of THAT one that might be required to restore Nezuko's humanity.Tanjiro, for his part, is a pretty Standard Issue hero- cheerful, good natured, as noted having a nuanced view of his opponents, but nevertheless resolute. ABOVE ALL ELSE, resolute. (We have in this show the shonen trope of the hero's being able to carefully think through his attacks in the middle of charging toward an opponent. I really don't think anyone's brain works QUITE that fast, but OK.) He does have one near-superpower: an unusually keen sense of smell.Nezuko, though, is a true marvel. Despite now having a demon form she nevertheless retains much of her humanity, including her devotion to her brother, but now that's enhanced with the ferocity and strength of a demon. She's as formidable as Tanjiro in a fight against demons, when she's literally let out of her box. (Tanjiro carries her around in a crate on his back- remember, demons can't be exposed to sunlight. I would think having an extra 50 kilos or so on his back would slow him down in fights, but he seems to manage OK.) She saves her brother's hide more than once.Tanjiro acquires a couple of sidekicks during the show, and it's here that I formed the opinion that while the show does action extremely well, and pathos well enough, it kind of flops at comedy.",5,8,/user/ur30753782/?ref_=tt_urv

This clash between Tanjiro and this villain possesses the best animation I've ever seen paired with incredible voice acting and music. This moment alone would make the show worth watching, however the build up to this climax is incredible as well, as we go from Tanjiro's journey to become a Demon Slayer to his first missions and him finding friends and potential ways to cure his sister along the way. The season comes full circle after some of the most beautiful action ever put to screen gave us our fill of demons for a little while. We get an incredibly humorous yet character driven bunch of episodes near the end. The characters in this show are all very good and will be even better in the future I'm sure. This is one of my favorite anime of 2019 and if the movie and next couple seasons turn out good, it could even better. Demon Slayer is a modern classic in the making that anybody can binge watch easily.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur113370202/?ref_=tt_urv

The drama and the intensity pick up towards the latter half of the show but the pacing gets better only slightly. I don't get how we're not told anything about the ""Breathing Styles"" - this kid goes ON AND ON about ""Water Style""; nothing about the levels - you were on LEVEL 2 an episode ago, Tanjiro! How did you get to level 10 in a span on 20 mins for us, but < 5 mins in your battle, and then be surprised at Tomioka's 11th level?And don't get me wrong, I am not hating on the show, I just wanna be able to see what everybody else see.

The action is fluid and breathtaking to watch, there are some weird visuals that create comedic scenes really well and overall stunning backgrounds. The story is incredible as well, and actually keeps the plot throughout the story. At some points it does feel like the characters aren't doing anything meaningful, but if you keep watching everything always pieces together. The beginning is incredibly unique and really brings into the story straight away before rapidly speeding up, the show wastes no time at the start showing training or anything like that, it just does it. The ending, albeit unfinished, idk haven't seen the movie yet, is incredibly heartwarming and has got me hyped for what's next. Now the characters, oh man the characters are excellent. Every has there own defining personalities and traits with good qualities and not so good qualities that all lead to great character development. Not only this but every character has there own backstory that is briefly shed light onto somewhere in the story, even the villains have moments of understanding and makes you feel real sympathy for them. I don't really have any negatives about the show, I had goosebumps at some points, it's been a while since any tv show or movie has made me have goosebumps. 10/10 good stuff let's see the rest of it tho.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur112234773/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9335498,ur3533814,1,30 June 2019,"Kimetsu no Yaiba is just the latest in the Shounen Jump catalogue to see an anime adaptation. From ufotable the studio behind such works as The Garden of Sinners and the more recent entries of the Fate/Stay Night franchise the studio shows an uncompromising visual flair for some highly stylized and impressive animation. Stellar fight scenes are sure to dazzle the eyes but really what holds this show down from being able to break the tropes of other stories from this demographic magazine is just how much the writing is mismatched and all over the place. It's not awful, there are some legitimately good moments in this but it seems every decent moment gets instantly replaced by five more questionable to downright stupid writing mistakes.Though this is an action show, animated and brought to life by our very eyes, the show doesn't seem to think we can understand anything as our main character has to constantly walk us through every single fight. Sometimes it works and makes sense as he plots out his next move, other times it's just annoying and makes you want to shout out ""SHUT UP"" the first rule of film making is often, show don't tell. Well this not only tells me, it tells me while it's showing. It makes sense in the context of a manga, where you are limited to just a few panels at a time to convey a scene but you think the animators would realize they aren't as confined. This isn't a low budget series either, not that would be any excuse considering I've seen low budget anime do just as impressive action sequences without the play-by-play. This is an action show not a sports/tournament show!Our main character is on a quest to save his younger sister, wonderful, I love stories like that! The sister character in this case being turned into a demon who still is restrained from craving human flesh as other demons do was set up so spectacularly then it came crashing down as it was bizarrely revealed via flashback that she's in a state of hypnosis to perceive everyone as her family members. Well first it's a wasted chance to show maybe she still has humanity in her, secondly the way that was conveyed makes it feel like an afterthought.Then later annoying comic relief character who won't stop screaming shows up who also has some stupid ability like being able to magically kill in his sleep. Again the way this is conveyed just feels like an afterthought. Points this time for not relegating it to a random flashback but maybe I'd have an easier time believing he passed the ""exam"" if that had been established then and there. You know that brutal final exam that Tanjiro walked away from alive but not without a good beating. I guess annoying sidekick just got lucky with a easy demon? Comic relief is good in a show like this but laying on thick when I expect a bit more dread really takes away from the show.Other high points for this series is the terrific soundtrack, featuring great opening and ending themes by LiSA of SAO fame (or infamy?) and a pounding score by Yuki Kajiura and Go Shiina. At this point this OST is the only thing keeping me going in this series because who can take this seriously anymore between screaming side character, plank of wood MC, cute demon sister, and hastily thrown out there plot points. If you're looking for a lot of pretty action sequences without any depth ala SAO then this show will be right up your alley.",33,107,/user/ur3533814/?ref_=tt_urv

Tanjiro hopes after he find Kibutsuji Muzan, he will seek for answer to heal his sister.

Also the story is not slow-paced like other long-run type of animes. The story is precise, right to the point, and not adding so many uneeded scenes. Some long-run type animes usually add so many uneeded scenes in the middle of the battlefight, but this anime is different. It is not following the formula. It only add a few character's background scene without dragging the whole series. The anime is brave, not afraid to show sadistic scenes with very very good suspense skill from the writer and without making the viewers ill. Some of the story was really sad and depressing, and it keeps me missing. Even i'm still not read the manga before, but this anime series definitely deserve to be applaused.The animation is marvelous. It delivers so many vibrant colours, vibrant characters design, vibrant art customes, good environment settings, and breathtaking action scenes.

tt9335498,ur125934623,8,8 May 2021,"Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted boy , who lives with his family in the mountain. One day, when he comes home, he discovers that his family had been attacked and slaughtered by the demon. Nezuko was the sole survivor of that attack but she has been transformed into a demon. Despite being a demon, Nezuko surprisingly showed signs of human emotions and thought. But this begins Tanjiro's journey to to help his sister turn human again and avenge the deaths of the rest of his family.Firstly, even though, there isn't much excitement in the initial episodes, I wouldn't call it boring. Imagine that, it took around 70 episodes for Naruto to cover the Genin training and the Chunin exams arc but Demon slayer covers Tanjiro's training as a slayer and the Final selection in just 5 episodes. So, I wouldn't really call it stretched. It is just what it is. However, it is after that till the 17th episode, we see the introduction of some characters and the mangaka (or perhaps the anime) really took a lengthy route to do so. There were some fights and arcs just to give us a brief idea about some new significant characters. It is during this phase, the storyline appears stretched and the plot progression remains slow. But once the plot starts progressing, the anime really looks something at a masterpiece level. What adds to the beauty are the breathtaking action scenes, top notch animation and the exciting, awesome and orgasmic OSTs.There are some amazing and unpredictable characters and that's what keeps you interested in this anime. The main characters, the supporting characters and even the significant villains will have something that could surprise you and as of yet none of the characters feels wasted. This isn't a typical Shounen anime. The protagonists have sad backstories but there is no unnecessary heroism. It is amazing how the characters' personalities are human-like and yet so unpredictable. The villains too aren't really caught in some kind of a betrayal twist. Their downfall is pretty straightforward and yet it manages to keep us exciting and in the end, manages to give us the chills. This anime might revolutionized the Shounen genre like how Akira did back in the 80s.

tt9335498,ur48454086,5,16 April 2021,"I enjoyed this series for about 8-9 episodes, but then what annoys me most about anime, which the series had thus far avoided, began to take over: googoo eyes and slide whistles, weirdly goofy animation effects that would have fit better in a 70s Hanna Barbera show. Is it an intense series with demons and blood and sword fighting, or is it a show for 6 year olds? If I wanted this kind of annoying childish nonsense, I'd watch Tom and Jerry. The other annoying element, which became a frequent staple after the 8th or 9th episode is that the characters are very screamy. They get into screaming fits about mundane, petty things, several times an episode. Again, this had not been a problem for the first 8 or 9 episodes. Animation producers often can't seem to find the line between entertainment for young children and entertainment for teens and/or adults. There are numerous and excellent anime series that avoid the childish googoo Tom and Jerry stunts, and they're still great entertainment. It drives me crazy that so many of them have subject matter and style that are more mature, but they feel they can't go without the kookoo kiddy junk. I don't have the patience for it, so I quit. I fast-forwarded through a few episodes, and found more and more frequent screaming fits and exclamation points above the heads, so I was done. I wish they had stuck with their style without caving to whatever studio or distributor hack who forced them to (or whatever they were smoking that made them think that they should) shift to a more childish presentation.That aside, the animation (aside from the later ridiculous elements) is beautiful, and there are some interesting, but not any real deep or surprising, story elements. The demons are great, and although it's a bit cliche at times, the training and the fighting are well designed. My only gripe with the fighting element was that after the training episodes were over, the main character was suddenly, mysteriously endowed with magical abilities that were never even hinted at while he was learning how to fight.The story is a classic patriarchal allegory on the vulnerability and weakness of young women. The sister is possessed by a debonair, good-looking demon--a metaphor for being exposed to sexual impulse, or simply life outside of the protected family life--and she becomes corrupted. The only way to save her from the evil is to muzzle her--don't let her speak or express herself--and to lock her up in a box--think medieval stories of princesses locked in towers--and of course, she needs a male to be her savior. You'll notice the victims of the ""demons"" are almost exclusively teenage girls, and the demon slayers are almost all men or teenage boys. I'm not rejecting the story on that count, though. It's a fun fantasy for teenage boys. But it's not useless to see things as they are, and these gender tropes are from a centuries old playbook of how to depict male strength and female weakness.Give it a try, and if you don't mind blatant sexism and annoyingly childish and completely unnecessary little-kid-comedy, you may enjoy this more than I did. There are certainly things to like about it.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur48454086/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9335498,ur5392144,7,23 July 2020,"The general trend when it comes to consumption of shonen anime is that most of them are generic, or if entertaining, they are shallow other than the fights--rarely are they ever as well-written or inventive as the most acclaimed shows in other genres. It can be hard to find the time for the often poor pacing and massive running length of many of the shows (One Piece is over 900 episodes, Naruto is 220, and DBZ is 291), and I find myself, at best, simply watching a few of the fight scenes on youtube or the sakuga videos of key animators, and never touching the series.An emotional core and compelling characters are a necessity to heighten the impact of the fight scenes so they're more than hollow but pretty bursts of action choreography and flashy explosions. Does KNY achieve that? For the most part, it does.While I wouldn't say KNY has an especially original story or setup, and the main character, like many a shonen main, is your average kind and determined young man who cherishes his friends, the show manages to be well-paced, and the writing, though simple, is adequate and often hits just the right notes to create an emotional impact when combined with the excellent production values from Ufotable and the score from Yuki Kajiura and Go Shiina.First of all, the story takes place in Taisho-era Japan (1912-1926). It's probably difficult to approximate the year until Tanjiro makes it to the city. Unbeknownst to most of the Japanese citizens, demons prey on unsuspecting humans. Tanjiro returns home to find his family slaughtered, with the exception of Nezuko, his sister, however, she is now a demon. A demon slayer comes along to exterminate her, but the siblings still share a bond and protect each other, so the demon slayer sends Tanjiro to be trained by one of the demon slayer corp and allows Nezuko to live.Though Nezuko has a sort of bamboo ""muzzle"" to dissuade her from biting humans, she manages to communicate through body language and remains an effective, though quiet character, managing to be far more expressive than the characters in plenty of the most generic anime, despite not being able to talk. One of the most important themes is the connection of family, the two refusing to part ways, though one is a human and the other a demon. What constitutes a family is a constant question, best exemplified by the spider clan in a terrifying inversion of what a family should be. From the very beginning, the strong bonds of family is a core part of the emotional impact that KNY builds on.It's not just the siblings that provide a much needed emotional glue, but throughout, the many demonic villains are humanized--for they were once all human, and they have their own problems. Though Tanjiro knows he must exterminate them, he has a respect for them, often comforting them or talking to them as they expire.In one especially touching moment, when Tanjiro is swooping in for the kill, he notices that one demon has given up, and he switches his mode of attack, killing her in the most gentle and painless way that he possibly can. In the kind of shonen of today, where there is such glory in vanquishing one's enemy, it feels almost surreal.Another fight during the spider arc has the dialogue and themes building up scene by scene, and the animation is pushed to the limits of the studio's budget as Nezuko and Tanjiro work together, featuring some of the most breathtaking visuals of the year and a perfectly synchronized song to heighten the emotional impact. I honestly can't think of many action scenes in an anime that are as powerful.The visuals are especially noteworthy as Ufotable seems to have mastered the use of computer-assisted camera work for very dynamic camera movement, as is on full display in the arc with the demon who can manipulate the dimensions of buildings, and the labyrinthine world that the lead villain summons his disciples to. The elemental attacks are all handled in a way reminiscent of old Japanese paintings--think of the famous waves painting from Hokusai.Of course, while the writing works very well in some scenarios, the emotion is there, the camerawork is great, and the fight scenes are exciting, there are some issues to address.Many of the characters are being introduced in the first season for greater roles in the following season, but for the more established characters, there's Zenitsu. His lighting attacks are very flashy, but his behavior is some of the most obnoxious I've seen from a main character. Sure, I understand his fear of death, his neuroticism, and even the comic relief of him proposing to every girl and getting rejected, but the writer pushes all of this to extremes. The comic relief is often just not funny and has zero timing. There are scenes that go on for minutes with Zenitsu freaking out and screaming, and it's obvious he's intended to be insanely pathetic so he can have an easy, obvious character arc without much effort.Inosuke is mostly easier to put up with. He's a beast-like man who grew up in the wilderness. It's difficult to get used to his setup of a boar mask and pants, sans shirt, but his reckless personality is far more palatable than Zenitsu's. He's hit or miss, but the comic relief is still not great.If the comic relief had been toned down, and the character interaction was just a little more serious among the three, this probably would have benefitted the pacing and tone. The show is not that dark, and there isn't a need to balance it with such heavy doses of comic relief.And while the writing is good when it comes to many of the character interactions outside of the most awful moments with the trio, the actual story is very simple, and they pretty much just go from one place to the next, vanquishing demon after demon.At first I considered rating KNY a 6 for some of it's flaws, but I had to keep it a 7 when I was reminded of the strong emotions in many scenes and how well-executed this series was as a shonen. Hopefully, the movie and the next season will improve in terms of the dynamics with the trio and will keep up a similar quality in other areas. It's well worth trying for a good shonen with a much needed emotional core.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur5392144/?ref_=tt_urv

Despite all the ferocious and insidious demons on their way, these siblings manage to find live, support, compassion and help from other slayers. Truly, the animation is eye-popping! I still wonder how the Japanese can impersonate the essence of different characters. Even the main antagonist Muzan has was excellently depicted, having his own cruel and severe intentions.In particular, the protagonist Tanjiro really demonstrates his faith and hope in finding the remedy for his sister, and that he is ready to jeopardise his life for her sake.

This anime had a mix of everything from sadness to comedy to beautifully animated, breath-taking fight scenes. Straight from the first episode I was in love with this show. Personally I don't like over-powered main characters specially ones with a hero complex or so but Tanjiro's Character was written so beautifully everything about him was great. To be honest I love a sister-loving Elder brother in Animes and specially in shounen anime. I love how the entire point of Tanjiro's life was turning his sister back into human and that's what the show is all about i do not want to give any spoilers but everyone will definitely love this show.

The animation team deserves a Nobel peace prize for this. The animation is such high quality it puts every other anime to shame. Even Mob Psycho 100 season 2 is looking weak in comparison. I don't even understand how the animation team can set the bar this high. Episode 19 made my eyes have an actual eyegasm. I've heard some call this anime cliche in how it follows that same old Shonen formula and on one hand I can see that but at the same time, it improves on every possible thing you can compare it to. It also helps that the color palette is so freaking beautiful. 10/10 no other anime compares to this atm and if there even ever is one, it's likely because Demon Slayer/Kimetsu No Yaiba set the bar so overwhelmingly high.",1,4,/user/ur52498144/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9335498,ur102266923,6,29 December 2020,"Put simply, the best and most praiseworthy aspects of the series were its design, art style, and animation, while some of the characters and the story writing could've used some polishing.It isn't hard to see why Demon Slayer is very well received, because that is exactly what the series excelled at: its visual design and action sequences. From its very first episode to the last, Demon Slayer never fails in this department, delivering a clean and appealing animation style when it is focused on the main storyline of Tanjiro and Nezuko Kamado's journey.It is when other characters enter as the story progresses that the series starts to show its flaws. For the most part, characters beside Tanjiro and Nezuko have their own charm and are able to fulfill their roles well. However, there are also characters who haven't been fleshed out enough to leave a strong impression before the story moves on to its next part. Even the backstories for these characters seemed half-baked, and are only there for the purpose of giving the viewers some sort of understanding to the characters and a shallow attempt at obtaining sympathy for them. The strong traits displayed by some overbearing characters cannot be downplayed by how irritating their personalities can be, which is probably turned up for comedy even if it isn't at all funny, especially when the mood changes from fun to serious. You'll often find tropes like these in other series in the same vein, just done smoother.There are a lot more anime series out there that have done better at developing a story in the course of fewer episodes than in the first season of Demon Slayer. Parts that are made to be funny at times come out as obnoxious and uninteresting, and the story writing leaves a lot to be desired with several parts condensed in 26 episodes, compromising its build-ups and character depth for the thrill of the hunt.Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has a lot of potential. It has lived up to the hype for the elements it is praised for, namely design and animation, but delivers an underwritten story which could have made this anime series superior to its peers in the adventure and fantasy genres had it been given just as much attention the design and animation got.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur102266923/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9335498,ur121054481,10,19 July 2020,"2019, by God's grace, delivered as with cool awesome anime titles. Kimetsu no yaiba is one of such brilliant titles. What I love about this show is the originality and uniqueness it represented. Just like similar 2019 releases such as vinland saga and the promised never land, the first season of the anime strayed a path that made it unique and did not bow down to various anime cliches. Another to be said of the show is the fact that it does not rely on female fan service to stimulate viewers' interest. Just like most classics, this anime is too busy pulling out heart-breakers, cliffhangers, mysteries and cool battles.
When the cause behind the creation of the demons was revealed early on in the show, I thought that was the end of an anime that started great because titles such as Attack on titan, parasite, bleach, and promised never land made the effort the cloud their viewers in a whole of mysteries before revealing what was behind their paranormal entities. This show takes a brunt and straight approach with the mystery part but don't underestimate it like I did. The episodes get even better and better from there. The turn of events make you really hate the villain like we are also supposed to.
The show also thrives on awesome but very scary and intense battle scenes. The battle scenes make the viewer feel like they can lose the main characters to death at any moment. Our main characters are always outclassed by the villains or demons they face especially halfway from season one. They do not save themselves by gaining new powers either. They are the same humans battling powered beings throughout the show making improvements only in fighting abilities. We get this feeling throughout the show that the main characters are at least going to lose an arm in this battle. The animation was great and a well done job to the studios behind it. Same goes for the song and voice cast too. The first season of kimetsu no yaiba has set the series on the pedal of a classic.

tt9335498,ur21034576,8,7 October 2021,"A few years ago when Demon Slayer first came out it was the talk of everybody in my circle of friends who are into Anime, I was so busy with other Manga and Anime so I had to pass on this, I have the habit of not buying into whatever is the new hot thing entertainement wise because usually people hype it up to such a level that it's impossible not to feel underwhelmed after you finally catch up with it. So the best tactic is to wait for the hype to die down and then sit down and see what all the fuss is about.Demon Slayer is not going to reinvent the wheel, it's not a game changer and certainly not going to make my top 10 all time favourite Anime however it is still a very well made show, in a nutshell it is your typical shonen that's elevated by it's impeccable technical aspects. The animation is to die for blending hand drawn with 3d effortlessly, it all moves fluidly and the colors Oh my god the colors are breathtaking! On the other hand you got the music which fits this show to a tee, I'm sure going to have to get the album for this asap as it's exactly my cup of tea.The lead, Tanjiro, is the most wholesome protagonist this side of Gon Fritz, the man is basically an angel and that's a huge turn off for me as I'm more into dark and messed up protagonists (Eren Yeager in the war on Marley arc from AOT springs to mind from recent memory) his bond with his sister is the catalyst for this story for his drive is not to be number one at doing his thing but rather to gain his sister's humanity back and he is willing to lose his own in the process (not gonna happened obviously). The supporting cast are more colorful featuring a healthy mix of badasses (the upper rank demon slayers) and the comic relief (Tanjiro's rag tag group aka boar head and cry baby) they both have their moments but I couldn't stop laughing at their antics and i'm a person who rarely laughs when watching movies.Demon Slayer offers loads of entertainement and is a feast for both the eyes and the ears. I'm probably not singing its praises all that much because it was way overhyped for me so it was inevitable that i was going to be a bit underwhelmed, just don't expect the best or most original story ever as well as not the best action and you should greatly enjoy it.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur21034576/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9335498,ur121080618,10,27 August 2020,"I was hesitant to watch this show because I had previously read some reviews saying this show was overhyped. Allow me to politely disagree and here's why I think it deserves the all the hype and perhaps even more than the one it gets. Firstly, the animation alone makes this show worth at least check out. The bright colors, scenery, character design are absolutely impeccable. Especially for me how they designed the main character, Tanjiro was beautiful. I love how they made him stand out from other characters but not over the top different. I love his earrings! I also love Tomioka, he was so cool! The music and openings were also outstanding! I never skipped them even once!! They got me hyped up!! I even ended up looking forward to the little Taisho secrets in the end! They were so cute! The characters are all incredible. I love how they made everyone's personality obvious and straight forward, sometimes over the top, which added a comedic touch to the show. To the people saying Tanjiro lacks character development: he lacks character development because he doesn't need one. Not every character needs one and that's okay. He is portrayed as a pure generous and sweet soul since ep 1. He's totally a sweetheart. Another thing is that the show is only starting out, people generally don't change drastically that fast. We do see him develop his skills throughout the show and that on itself is really amazing!This show has something for everyone: fantasy, comedy, action, a touch romance.

-High tier animation
-Quality soundtrack that sounds both reminiscent of older anime (ghost in the shell comes to mind) while still being fresh and new.-Compelling world
-Some of the characters are super adorable
-interesting powers which are amped by the strong visuals.-Isn't aimed at kids. Even more than Bleach or Naruto. This is clearly a pg-13 level show or higher. Prostitutes, blood, character deaths, polygamy). Allows more people to take it seriously rather than writing it off as a kids anime that happens to also engage an older audience (like avatar the last airbender).-Character designs are memorable (something Kubo with Bleach excelled at).Arguable
-Tanjiro's power increases might be Deus ex machina at times. Waiting to see how it is fleshed out in future episodes (father; sun breathing etc)
-Zenitsu is often annoying (tho things being toned down as the series progresses)
-like many Shonen anime the main character is bland. This is often done so viewers can relate to them more (wider demographic appeal) but makes them appear a bit boring. (The more anime you have watched the more noticeable this may be to you so for some viewers you may not notice or be bothered by this)
-powers fall on the soft magic side vs the hard magic system (Gandalf vs H x H). A bit vague. They either work or don't work for the sake of the plot/narrative. Still waiting to learn more from the world building)Improves
-Characters cry more than Deku from my hero academia (understandable in a literal sense because they are child soldiers, but watching this every 3 episodes lessens their impact)
-Characters are a bit tropey. Like you've seen all these character types before in other anime.-buys into the trope of most power fantasy anime with ""hidden powers"" when needed for poor convenience (Deus ex machina)
-nezukos power increases need more prep work (when exactly is she training? She's always in a box)
-lack of development for secondary characters like Inosuke and zenitsu. Like, their base strength is improving and we see why, but what about their abilities? + nezuko barely is a character and more an adorable plot point)
-power system (hashira and the 8 levels below that) are mostly pointless/forgotten since the main characters sporadically change strengths for plot points + it mostly is ignored/irrelevant unless you are hashira level. Kind of like in Bleach. If you weren't vice captain level or higher it becomes kind of moot to the story. But Bleach succeeds by not focusing on those levels for obvious reasons. They know there's no point.",1,2,/user/ur127350244/?ref_=tt_urv

Animation does make it look pretty, but what's the point of a good fight scene if your not invested in the characters. Demon Slayer weakest point is its characters. I would appreciate if they spent more time on the characters. The plot of the story is a little bit Clichéd. The story follows Tanjiro whom family was killed, besides his little sister, Nezuko who turned into a demon. This plot is very interesting and it makes you want to care for Tanjiro to succeed, but it's the other characters that make me lose my interest in the story.

They need to do better with music editing. Some battles' epicness is taken away by the un-epicness of the background music.
2. Too much internalization. I know internalization is part and parcel of animes but goddamn the main character just won't shut up for a second.
3. Above all, the anime has a mediocre and typical storyline. The main character sets out on a quest to find the cure for his sister. To this end he must fight demons, which is basically like every other shounen anime ever. That's it. There's nothing else to the story. No depth. No complexity. To make up for the lackluster storyline, the author just includes some fanservicing scenes with cute adorable characters.

No.Demon Slayer is a great adventure about a teenager who will do everything in his power to save his sister. It's funny, dark and action packed. Everything an anime fan would hope for. Not me.Ufotable... does a spectacular job. The animation is stunning, artistic, and mind blowingly well done. This is one of the few animations where I can safely say that both CG and hand drawn animation were perfectly combined.Demon Slayer lacks plot. It honestly does. If you watch this because of the story, you'll be very disappointed. The story revolves around the characters going from point A to point B, and from B to C. However, whenever the show is about to get boring, the director comes in.The best example of direction from the show is from the episode ""Hinokami"". That episode beautifuly encapsulates everything Demon Slayer represents. The mix between the score, and the flashbacks and the action, all create a very engaging ride. You'll definetely find yourself cheering for the characters.The characters are great. Tanjiro, specifically, is very relatable. He feels guilty for not being there when his familly needed him the most. Now, he'll do everything to redeem himself from past mistakes and also save his sister. Tanjiro and Nezuko's relationship is the beating heart of the story.The first half of the show feels too dark. I was talking to a friend of mine. He said: Demon Slayer wouldn't work if it was too dark. I 100% agree with him. By the second half of the show you'll realize that it becomes a lighter adventure. Bringing new characters to make the tone lighter, was the best decision the author could have done for this story. It's characters, Inosuke and Zenitsu, both bring a breath of fresh air to the story. I dare to say, they are vital to the show.I also want to higlhlight the villains of the show. The author did a good job by fleshing out them. Seeing their struggle and their past gives a sense of depth and stakes to the conflicts between the heroes and villains. My favorite villain is Rui.Demon Slayer has it's ups and downs.

My Rating 8/10.Demon slayer : kimetsu no yaiba - Anime Series, 26 Episodes each of 24 min / Ufotable studious / Genre - Action, fantasy, comedy / R - 17+ (violence & profanity)Synopsis - The kamado's family lives happily and peacefully on a remote mountain. One day our main character, Kamado Tanjirou found out his entire family is slaughtered by Demon and only left his little sister turns into a Bloodthirsty demon. Along with his sister, Tanjirou starts a journey and become a demon slayer to avenge his family and find a cure for Nezuko to turn her back into a human.Pros - On the surface, Demon slayer looks like a decent shonen with a lot of action, a simple plot, hilarious comedy but its not just a regular shonen, with it's Cutting edge animation, amazing soundtrack, uniquely crafted action scenes Demon slayer totally deserves in the top 10 anime of 2019.I loved how the different fighting styles showed in an artistic way. like Tanjirou's breath of water, Zenistu's thunderstorm style. The majority of the series consists of battle scenes. The way of telling the story in between battles like flashbacks of a demon, the background story of our protagonists makes every battle invested more emotional and With the satisfying sound mix, breathtaking visuals, mesmerizing soundtrack, make every action scenes spectacularly gorgeous. Ufotables studio is done a brilliant job.Demon slayer also has some decent protagonists, our main lead Tanjirou a nice guy sees human even in demons, Zenistu a silly hilarious guy even though he battles rarely his actions scenes, past story stole the audience, Inosuke he will do anything to prove himself And after seeing adorable, badass Nezuko, no wonder all over internet people are praising her and the memes...And the Story is simple not necessarily a bad thing, not every movie/anime should have a deeply complicated story, when focusing on other aspects and performed right it doesn't matter. This is true when for Demon Slayer.Cons - All minor issues mentioned below are until episode 10 only.
The starting episodes are super rushed. It doesn't take time for emotional scenes and changes the environment to comedy. Story and battles seemed repeated.Verdict - Demon slayer is absolutely worth the time, it's entertaining, and with futuristic Animation, crafted fight scenes its unique from regular Shonen anime. Absolutely recommended. Looking forward to Season 2.

The quality of the art work and animation is top class and the music and soundtrack are also extremely good and of a very high standard.
The story itself was amazing and kept me interested from start to finish and I can't wait to continue Tanjiro and Nezuko's story when the movie arrives.
The relationship between the brother and sister was very moving and well voice acted by the Japanese actors.
The ""demons"" were very imaginative and the battle scenes were incredible from start to finish. The use of 3D animation for some of the battles was very well done and did not detract all at.
Tanjiro shows great compassion and maturity through the show which really impressed me. It made the anime feel more grown up and mature.
Unfortunately there are comedy elements which I found very jarring and annoying in at times. The Inosuke and especially Zenitsu characters felt out of place considering the dark, horror tone of the anime and made it feel somewhat childish to me.

Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight-his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.Kimetsu no Yaiba has a great story.
This is your typical Shounen anime but done damn right.The story is somewhat new in a sense and character location or setting I would say is also kind of new to me in shounen anime, I am saying this because now days shounen anime always start in a city or suburb areas. Its nice to see this anime start the story from middle of nowhere kind of setting (given this anime takes place in past, its not new but different in my opinion).
The only tiny bit problem is that occasional use of CG models of characters when they are far in the view or are fast moving, but this use of CG is ten times better than what we got for goblin slayer. When its comes to using CG studio Ufotable is leagues ahead in the competition and it shows here.This is only anime I am enjoying, which is doing action scenes right.

tt9335498,ur133021447,5,26 May 2021,"The story of demon slayer is pretty simple. Tanjiro is the main character, his familiy gets killed by a demon only his sister survived. Now he is becoming a demon slayer to hunt the demon who murdered his family. For that he'll be part of an organization, called demon slayer corps, which a ranking system going from 1 to 10. On this journey he meet two other young demon slayer, which then accompaing him on his quest.Well, reading that you might see many pretty generic plotlines. Of course, that must not be bad per se. But the thing here is, that the characters are quite flat. Our young hero Tanjiro for example is really nice and friendly, thats it. He has no flaws, no errors. He has a tragic backstory, cries sometimes and must train more to become stronger... wow, never heard that before. Same goes for all the other characters and also for the world. Like the ranking system for the organization, it was just once mentioned. During the first season we only get to know members from the highest rank. What about all the other ranks? ( It would be like in One Piece during the first 100 episode we will only meet yonkos ). And to the style of the main characters: The main characters look so much out of place with the hair and the styling, compared to other people. And nobody is paying attention to that (not like in FMA were everybody is constantly looking at them)
What really is amazing about the tv show is the animation and beautiful drawing. It is really top, watching the episode 19 season 1 was really amazing. Also the music is quite good.

tt9335498,ur133810117,8,30 June 2021,"As I was watching the first episode of Demon Slayer (DS), I couldn't help but notice some similarities between DS and Attack on Titan (AOT). I thought it would be interesting to compare the two.The story of both shows are very similar. The main character lost his family due to creatures of which the origin is unknown. The main character then gets trained to fight these creatures and to find a cure to get rid of the dark forces that inhabit these creatures that were once human. The main character also utilises these dark forces to support his cause. The differences story-wise become more apparent as the show progresses. The creatures in DS all have different powers, as opposed to the creatures in AOT of which the vast majority has similar powers. The creatures in DS offer more variety and this makes it fun and interesting to see what the main characters have to come up with to beat them. The motives of the big bad in DS seem to be more of a cliche instead of nuanced, but it is too soon to tell.The similarities in character are present, but not as much as in the storyline. The main character is a young boy who is accompanied by a female companion who is a total badass and a male companion who seems to be a coward, but turns out to be very brave. The differences are the intentions of the main characters. Tanjiro is pure good. His character is similar to Avatar Aang in the sense that he is a kind, helping, and sincere character that wants to save the good and the bad. This makes him less realistic, but more likeable. Also, the main character is not the creature. Instead, it is the female companion called Nezuko. The characters of DS are less conflicted than the characters of AOT and therefore lack real depth. Don't get me wrong, the characters have interesting back stories, but none of them have shown any major inner conflicts. That being said, DS has only one season and AOT 6.DS is still very young and has a lot of potential to become something entirely different from what we've seen in AOT. I think the story of DS will go its own way and have more of its own identity in the upcoming seasons. The fight scenes of DS are incredible (just like the fight scenes of AOT) and the choreography seems to be well thought out. These scenes, especially when Zenitsu displays his formidable hidden powers, are exhilarating and it will be very interesting to see what the fire breathing will do to Tanjiro's abilities. I was kind of hoping Tanjiro was going to be the apprentice of Giyu (Water Hashira) but alas.Good show. A lot of potential, but I would like to see it break free from the AOT template and take on its own identity. If it manages to do that, we are in for a treat.",1,2,/user/ur133810117/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9335498,ur6013477,5,30 January 2021,"Art & Animation: The art isn't that good tbh, but the animation department did a really good job on this one. Maybe a bit too much CG for my taste though. The characters look cool, but there's not much detail.
Sound: Nothing special, didn't strike me as either good nor bad. The opening theme was nice.
Story: A real train wreck. There're humans, there're demons, and there're demon slayers. Those are the basics other than that they don't really explain anything in this show, they just state ridiculous facts. Why some humans are ridiculously strong? They got the correct breathing techniques. Right... Only swords made of a special ore can kill demons, a bit like silver but you also need to decapitate them. Also there's people (and cats, even ghosts) appearing from nowhere all the time. There's backstory on most demons they slay, like anybody cares, right? I'm not exactly sure what story this show wants to tell.
Character: The protagonist was fine, except for maybe the part where he forgot about his family being slaughtered fairly quickly. Besides him, there's quite a few cool looking characters, but they are all really cliché and shallow. All the Hashira (the strongest demon slayers) are basically one-trait robots and probably lacking a brain. Then we have the obnoxious friends: Zenitsu and Inosuke, literary always screaming. One is constantly afraid and screaming, the other only thinks about fighting and screaming, this gets exhausting fast. There's little logic in any action any character takes except for the protagonist. Also the manuscript is super basic, nothing interesting being said, mostly feels like forced dialogue.
Value: I would skip more than half of the episodes and just watch the good (fighting) parts, so I guess there's not much rewatch value really. I'd only recommend it to hardcore shounen fans.
Entertainment: I enjoyed the action episodes, everything else was pretty weak. The comedy parts in particular are ridiculously bad. The show seems to target an older audience with all the blood, torture and decapitations, but the comedy seems to target kids in preschool.Summary: It became clear to me after watching this show that the only trait that the average watcher these days care about is cool animations. People praising episode 19 made me think I was in for a real big twist, but it was only a few good fight scenes, not even that impressive. Was very dissatisfied with this show overall, it felt like it atleast could've been so much better if they only kept the serious parts and didn't do any comedy.",3,11,/user/ur6013477/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9335498,ur30736069,6,3 June 2019,"From the very beginning Blade Demon Slayer (aka Kimetsu no Yaiba) looked as something wonderful. A boy comes home and has all his family dead. All but one. His little sister is a blood-meat thirsty monster now.So the plot promised a lot of good in any way. Way A. The brother joins his sister as a minion and help her with eating innocent.
Way B. The brother and sister begin saving people, hunting things (hm, looks like it was somewhere on tv).But no. Suddenly a mysterious organisation appears out of nowhere and the brother has to join the group of nerds. And here how nerds they are.
they say it's hard for them to fight vs monsters. Because if a monster loses its hands it'll get new ones, but if a fighter loses his hands he will never be a warrior again.And how do these men solve the problem? 75% of their rookies have to die while passing the final exam. Evolution says the nerds are under extinction.
they send their privates here and there from a village to a city. Just send without paying money for the job.Really? How are the privates supposed to eat, to buy closes, pills? With robbing banks? Evolution can't keep silence again.
they are more cruel than the monsters. Monsters don't keep them in a prisons forever. Monsters don't use them as a doll for rookies training lessons. Monsters don't hypnotise them to make believe (it's your beloved family, protect them no matter what).But they do, monsters are nothing but things, toys for them.All the organisation way of the plot looks useless and excess.

tt9335498,ur7417923,8,29 December 2020,"Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the animes that give me the satisfaction that Bleach gives. It shares maaaaany similarities with Bleach such as, shikai, bankai, Gotei 13 divisions (Shinobu's team is like Division 4 and Shinobu (butterfly-poison) is similar to Sui Feng (bee-poison), Shinobu is like a combination of Sui Feng, Yoruichi and Unohana), the taichous, shinigamis, Ichigo (the way Tanjiro uses his physical power first and then when he cannot kill the demon the way he uses his mind, the way he trains himself, his father's powers and his ability to use these powers too), the way the demons behave/act (regrowing organs, magical powers, unique equipments, their numbers), Inoue's sympathy for Ulquiorra (Tanjiro's sympathy for Rui), etc. I know that that there are lots of common things from Japanese culture in animes bu this one has the same scenes/characters. Actually Kimetsu no Yaiba is some kind of dupe but it is still amazing. I can not understand how people can not see those similarities and rate this more than Bleach. Even tough Zenitsu and Inosuke are quite original and funny characters, Bleach characters and their background stories and features are much more instense, strong and original. I do not know the manga but I think Nezukachan's role could be boosted even tough she resembles Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul. The only better thing is that Kimetsu no Yaiba doesn't have any filler episodes or loooong recap sequences. The story flows very quickly increasing the adrenaline levels perfectly but this makes me think as if they slowed it down a little bit there would be more episodes to enjoy. Kimetsu no Yabia also resembles Rurouni Kenshin a lot. I think Kimetsu no Yaiba is some sort of mesh up but it gave me the thing I want, thus I definitely recommend this anime and the movie and I hope that they will film the rest of the manga which is finished. 8.5/10",1,4,/user/ur7417923/?ref_=tt_urv

The writing is all over the place, and nothing really makes much sense. There was some potential here, but it was thrown away pretty quickly. No story, the combat system is non existent, and the characters are the same as always. Not BAD, just not at all interesting.First of all, they can't decide whether to make regular humans ""realistic"" or ""super"". On one hand, they are supposed to be ""weak mortals"" that can't keep up with demon strength. On the other hand, the main character and his weakened sister defeat a feasting, full grown demon, and he later cuts through a boulder. So ok. Let's leave that for now.So the demons multiply by getting their blood on a human. But they need to eat humans, so there shouldn't ever be any ""human"" left when they're done. Because they also get stronger the more they eat. And it was explained that they have tremendous metabolisms, but the demon sister has gone a long time without eating anything. She should be dead.And of course anime always abuses the sense of smell, but he can smell traps as they appear, and can even smell OPENINGS in a persons guard? He can sense when a person is open, and knows when to strike based on scent? That makes no sense no matter how you look at it. That alone is enough for me to stop watching this.Bottom line, I've seen a lot of anime.

In my opinion, this anime is fantastic. Yes, the story is nothing new and doesn't try to re-invent the wheel but it is really fun and keeps your attention and interest throughout the whole 26 episodes. But, the strongest point of this anime is its visuals; they are just fantastic, and watching them makes you feel pleasure, even when the characters are just talking. Then, episode 19 arrives and everything gets blown away.
The only negative thing that someone could find annoying about Demon Slayer is the extreme personalities that every character has. The best example of this is Zenitsu, as his personality is always of a coward guy that loves girls, and every time that he is on screen he acts like that. Personally, I didn't found it annoying but a lot of people could.
So, in conclusion, I think that a demon slayer is an anime that could be enjoyed by anyone with fantastic characters and a really fun story.

It is his will and moral of saving others and furfilling his quest of helping his sister that drives him forward which means that gaining strengh is not the primarily focus which for me adds a new perspective to the show.

tt9335498,ur46029014,9,25 March 2020,"Now, let me clear first. I am not saying this show is bad. It is just so overrated to the point that it hurts!No offence to the people who like this show. I respect everyone's opinion and I am only sharing mine. Moving on... I found this anime too childish for me. No mature drama, Typical shounen plot, generic characters and villains. It simply didn't offer anything groundbreaking to the table.Yes, it having a 8.8 rating is just too much to bear. Why? Because, it makes it seem more good or equivalent to the true anime wonders: Samurai Champloo (8.5), Neon Genesis Evangelion (8.5), Steins;Gate (8.8), Code Geass (8.6), The Promised Neverland (8.8) and many more. But is it in par with these anime or even better? Hell no! It doesn't even come close to these shows. If you are a fan of shounen, I would highly recommend you to watch My Hero Academia. Now that is a shounen worth-watching. But it only has a rating of 8.5 while Demon Slayer sits on 8.8, which, in my opinion, doesn't make any sense and is so unfair and misguiding.Of course, the show has good points like the soundtracks - which are really good, and its animation. But hey, you can't rate a show so high just because of that.Furthermore, many people talk about Ep. 19 - which has a 9.9 rating. Let me break it down to you, it wasn't anything special as well. I admit, the one scene in it was animated way too beautifully that it got be shook - but that's just it! Nothing else. The whole episode was a fight scene that too was a generic one.Why I am writing this review is because I just finished Vinland Saga (a pure masterpiece) and started watching demon slayer, thinking it would be yet another show after Vinland that would make me go crazy but alas, all I found was mainstream shounen content with no emotion invoking depth. I was really disappointed.So, I would conclude that the rating of this show can very much deceive you. Do not let it! If you are in mood for pure shounen stuff with great music and animation, you can watch this show. But if you are in search for a masterpiece (or even less than that - like a pretty damn good show), keep searching and just skip this show!

I actually did find some enjoyment in Demon Slayer but feel that all the hype surrounding it feels a little exaggerated. Many people only praise this anime for two things - the animation and Nezuko.
And here is one bad part that is doing its best to ruin all enjoyment I get from this anime:
humor. It's horrible. Not just it is horrible, but it is completely out of place that makes it really awkward. I intended to ignore/accept it as inevitable up until episode 11, but here anime went all in.

tt9335498,ur119986657,3,20 June 2020,"It is hard to even begin to collect how many problems this show has. I would say there could be 3 big categories of problems 1) lack of real tension 2) lack of characters 3) lack of good dialouge.1.) Lack of tension: it is mind blowing how there are still people who cannot comprehend how stories work. They know you need a conflict, but fail to understand that conflict leads to tension, because there is an uncertainty created by the clashing of opposing forces. There are undesired and desired possible outcomes, and the uncertainty is created because you do NOT know which of them is going to happen. But if you eliminate the possibility for the negative outcome... meaning in a sword fight you make it VERY transparent that your hero is not going to loose or die... then you eleminate uncertainty, and with that, every tension you could ever hope to have.
Sadly this happens in demon slayer. Everyone knows the hero will never loose a fight, so in every fight scene I am left to just stare at the screen without any feeling of interest.. because we know what is going to happen.2.) Lack of characters: I think the writer really tried his/her best to make the most cliched, not interesting characters possible. THe main characters single characteristics is that he cares about his sister and people. Oh yea, and he can smell fear and deception, because... well because reasons.
His sister that we should care about has no personality either. She is drawn cute.. and that is it. Seems to me people like her for that reason, and because there is no incest thing going on between them. Do not get me wrong but I feel like this is a rather low standard, and is frankly insulting to any other decent character ever created.
Eventhough the main characters family is killed... nobody seems to care. I swear the main character doesnt spend whole 2 minutes thinking of them in 26 episodes (more than 8 hours!!!). I am pretty sure most of us dont even remember their names, or how many of them died there. THat is how important they are, their existance, or their death has no impact on anything at all. The heros goal is tied to changing back his sister which is in no logical connection to the death of anyone.3.) Lack of good dialogue: Even though fight scenes lack tension you could still have a good story if you have interesting characters with good conversations. But nope. Every line is so painful. Characters are saying stuff that either is not relevant to anything and adds nothing to their characters either, or they say thing we already know. One example of this is episode 6. In the beginning we see the main character is getting ready. His master (who is the most cliched master you could ever imagine) asks him if he is ready, to which the answer is.. yes.
WHAT IS THE POINT? Like honestly, the main character knows what he just did. I assume the master has eyes. I most certainly have eyes. Most viewers probably have eyes. This is fine for the first few times, but after a while it is painfully annoying. If your characters have nothing to say.. then dont make them.
Another examle is in the same episode, the conversation with the demon. So boring and pointless! It literally gives 0 new information (we knew girls are abducted, we knew, demons eat humans, we knew this demond most likely ate her.. so what is the point?) but it takes a lot of screentime while destroys every fear you might have of these creatures.Also, remaining at this point, I am begging you, please, please, PLEASE, if you at least try to attempt to make demons frightening.. could you not make them shout on a high pitched voice in the middle of a fight... ""you little punk!"". Like.. pretty please? At least try.So overall there is nothing of interest story wise. Characters are paper thin, dialouges are painful, and the fight scenes are pointless. It manages to fail at almost everything, which is exceptional.. but probably not the goal they had in mind.
Yes, the music and the animation are great. But honestly, unless you want pointless action with no tension and no characters.. you could still give it a try but I doubt you will enjoy.Now fans can go and find this not helpful because I told my opinion.",26,48,/user/ur119986657/?ref_=tt_urv

But that's just it, if you want complex drama filled plots then go read a book! Find a novel with no animation and sound and have your fill of complex plots and plot twists. Because if a show is to come to the screen with no visuals and audio but a great plot it should be considered a failure and should've been left in a book.This is a story of courage. Not giving up.

tt9335498,ur10008833,7,2 September 2020,"Update: It took me 24 episodes, but the show finally lived up to its hype. It got rough in the middle - Zenitsu is an extremely annoying character (but he gets better) - but if you stick it out, the show hits its stride. That sounds weird, given that I was down to a 4/10 at one point, but Season 2 feels like it will hit the ground running. I really ended up enjoying the show and can't wait for the next season.Original review: There's what, 26 episodes? I'm currently on episode 7 and I was hoping to be a fan by now, but I've got a ways to go, so who knows. Currently, my thoughts are: this show is overhyped. If an anime is good, I can usually look past the over-indulged sentimentality and heavy exposition, but this show soaks in it a little too much for my taste (read: a bit cheesy). I think part of the problem is that it seems too derivative and paint-by-numbers. The show follows an all-too-familiar template, and the writers don't do enough with the characters or the story to make it stand out. Plus, the main character just seems to cry all the time. Sure, so does Midoriya in MHA, but he's surrounded by great characters, writing, and top-notch animation.Overall, Demon Slayer is just OK. (*So far*.) I could understand a 7.5/10, but it's pulling in an 8.7, which I think is way too high. I hope further episodes change my mind, but I'm usually swayed one way or another at this point. As of right now, I'm going to give it a solid 6/10.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur10008833/?ref_=tt_urv

I think the series is good, but undeserving of the over the top praise it received. I think ufotable is annover rated studio, that while great, is nothing on the visuals of things like s 1 one punch man and mob psycho 100. One of my main issues with the series, and more and more anime now is constant ass pulls. The hero magically finds some new way of winning even when really it should be impossible. This is ok with stuff like JoJo where it's part and parcel, but please stop the poor writing and find ways to add tension to the battles. The series has good character designs, very good original voice actors (the dubs ok, yellow shirt crybaby character makes me wish I was deaf at times). If you can , watch this subbed. Action scenes are animated well, although there seems to be lots of stock footage, and flashy attacks, when I find well choreographed fast paced scenes more exciting. Dororo is flawless in this and it shows how good fights can be, so why all the fuss about this series fights? The plot is more like a villain of the week affair so far. Score is ok, nothing incredible. Still I do persevere with it and it's entertaining enough. Watch dororo if you want a real incredible story, animation, characters and sword fights.

I must say that even though I quite liked it and found it entertaining I think those statements are exaggerated.
The story is good but is not that original, it reminded me a little bit of ""Bleach"" and some vampire animes I've watched. The characters are charismatic overall but not very complex. There's one I couldn't stand at all though, he was extremely annoying everytime he popped up but my appreciation for the two main characters made things better so I'm going to let that go.

I love that talk between Shinobu and Tanjiro in ep. 24, when Shinobu talked about how her big sister was killed by some demon yet she still showed some compassion, while Shinobu herself couldn't come up with the same composure, and she sees Tanjiro as having close qualities with her sister. The tension of whether to feel pity over the demon's conscience as usually found moments before their death or to feel total disdain due to them taking away the humans' loved ones out of bare instincts is really strong to the point that it could surpass those complex emotions and challenge our usual logic and intellect.""Story: 8/10

This is because many of them take a while to build momentum and draw viewers in. Demon Slayer had me hooked from the very first episode. The tragic setup immediately got me invested in the characters, and the animation might just be the best I've seen in a modern anime. CG effects aren't overused, the scenery is gorgeous, and the character designs are rich and colorful. As you follow the main characters, you feel deeply involved with their quest- each time a new skill is mastered or a deadly foe is defeated, you really rejoice with the success. Beyond that, the protagonist of this story is deeply empathetic, kind, and well-rounded. I found this to be a breath of fresh air amongst too many shows that feature an angsty and shallow lead who is either revenge-driven or power-hungry.Give Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba a chance.

tt9335498,ur28382964,3,25 July 2021,"Most reviews on here will definitely tell you it's an ""awesome"" show and that the critics and ""haters"" are all wrong. Now, there's a reason they call it ""awesome"" or ""cool"" and it's because that's all it would be viewed as to a weeb. This show lacks any depth whatsoever and tries to tie any lazy backstory to any character in the blink of an eye to try to simulate some kind of deeper meaning behind their actions. Foreshadowing or setup to anything is basically non-existent and the protagonists just overcome any obstacle that comes their way very similar to a Mary Sue without any justification whatsoever. Meaningless villains, ""plotdriven"" episodes that can be reduced to just filler status, and of course cringy Anime humour consisting of superflous emotiveness and overacting. I've never called myself a fan of Anime but gave this series a chance and watched it from start to finish in one sitting despite this and while I can understand why a fan of this genre would be head over heels for this. But to speak of it's overall quality goes beyond what you're just a fan of and that's why it most likely will be showered with ""awesome""s and ""cool""s instead of any actual positive critisism. For anyone who is not already deep into the Anime culture this will not provide a pleasant experience upon viewing. Essentially this is just an unfocused journey of basically meaningless and randomly connected events that unfolds in nothing within it's first season and lacks any resolution so much so that I have no interest in following yet another redundant 10 hour journey of side-quest and filler that we would most likely see in season 2.

Most episodes were very boring, predictive and kept repeating themselves (encountering a demon, fighting, winning, backstory, repeat). Only 2 episodes were good for my taste and came up towards the end of the series. I watched the entire thing just to give an honest opinion but I would have given up after episode 5. If you have to watch so many episodes just to get something decent its not that good. Also besides the protagonist (has no personality other than being nice) and his sister (that was for me the best character), there are no other likeable characters , the rest are extremely annoying, almost unbearably so, I swear if I have to listen to that orange kid scream one more time...

It tries to start with a shocker at the beginning, which is diminished by the little exposition each character gets.
Looking at the story, one thing can be said, a good story continues intriguing when everything is NOT given away, but in this case all is within few episodes and there is no lingering mystery left in this series. Don't expect any twists, you get what was said in the first two episodes.Many talk about the superb fight scenes in this series. They would be if the main character didn't explain everything in most thorough detail. The Anime does not trust the audience to understand what is going on. Repeating the obvious disturbs the flow. Furthermore, you get some tiny expositions of the enemies, which, I would guess, tries to make one feel pity for the enemies, but they happen during fights and are very short. There is almost zero build up to make one feel anything.

tt9335498,ur92562981,6,30 September 2019,"I went into Kimetsu no Yaiba with high expectations. After all of the hype surrounding it within the anime community, I expected it to blow me away. Sadly, it didn't, and ultimately, I walked away from Demon Slayer somewhat disappointed. This anime definitely had its good points; however, sloppy writing and hollow characters ended up bogging this anime down.Let's start with the good.The animation was stunning, and the soundtrack was great.Ufotable did an excellent job with the animation as usual. The fights flowed smoothly, with careful detail and excellent utilization of different shot types throughout different scenes. The color palate was diverse and vibrant, which benefited the character designs and certain scenes greatly. I didn't pay much attention to the soundtrack, but when I did notice, it reflected themes appropriately and often would amplify moods within different scenes.Additionally, the story is decent.Minus a few conveniences here and there, the story is well developed with a clear villain and end goal. The power structure is well constructed, and changes in powers are not easily attained.Where did it struggle though?Well firstly, the characters. Yeah, they're likable.... that's it. If that's enough for you then this gripe doesn't hold much weight, but if you fancy all-around well-written characters, I don't think you'll find them here. What you'll find instead are characters that seem to revolve around a certain trait/group of traits that define their character and leave no room for realistic depth.Tanjiro is a generic and 1-dimensional main character. Okay cool, his family died and his sister became a demon so he's searching to find a cure. Okay cool, he's compassionate and kind towards almost everyone. That's great and all, but those things still don't tell me enough about his personality and character; they never really further his character later either. It seems like the writer just wrote down a handful of good traits and said, ""Hey, that's good enough for a main character."" They give him no real weaknesses other than his initial physical inferiority, which virtually makes him just as human as his demon sister. The fact that his character and actions throughout the story mostly revolve around other characters and events is a testament to how poorly established he is as a singular character.Zenitsu showed some promise during his initial introduction in the final selection arc and during the ""spider fight"" (I don't know what to call it) but ends up starting and finishing the same: a character for comedic relief, which would be fine if the satire in constantly screaming and complaining was actually funny to me.Inosuke is a loose cannon supporting character who doesn't have much to offer other than occasional comedic relief and utilization as another piece for fights.I really can't rip on Nezuko though; the writing mostly protects her character from criticism, and she's adorable.Speaking of the writing, it's not good. It's not awful, but it's not good. Honestly, it feels like this show was written for children. They constantly choose to tell instead of show or tell while showing. Nearly every action or emotion is either expressed through dialogue or inner monologue, which severely dampens the delivery of any emotional blow and makes the strong accompanying imagery practically superfluous.The dialogue also suffers severely from the lack of strong character foundation. It comes out awkward at times and mostly just serves to further the plot or to briefly check on the characters' states. The problem with the lack of revealing dialogue is the subsequent weak characters and character relationships. I can't even describe the primary character dynamics other than the words ""friendly"" and ""caring""; there's nothing remotely notable about them other than maybe Inosuke calling Tanjiro ""Monjiro"" and Zenitsu's dependency on Tanjiro.In the end, Kimestsu no Yaiba succeeds on certain levels but also fails on others. I came in with expectations of a masterpiece but left with a feeling of pseudo-fulfillment. Maybe if I started with lower expectations I would have a more positive reception. Nonetheless, it still emerges at the top of its respective season of anime, and I would probably recommend it to friends if I wanted to introduce them to anime. 6/10 now please proceed to find this to be not helpful because you disagree with my opinion.TLDR: Great animation, nice music, cool fights, Interesting plot and setting. Flat characters, awful writing. Depending on how you weigh different aspects, you may enjoy this quite a bit. I recommend it.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur92562981/?ref_=tt_urv

This sister is then also turned into a demon.One of my problems with the show is the fact that it is constantly breaking its own rules.

Later, when we meet Shinobou, the insect pillar, we find she is not able to cut through demons' heads and instead uses poison. It's constant things like this that make me shy away from this series.Another issue I have is with the constant bloating of quirky aspect of a single characteristic. Zenitsu is a freaky pervert who has an anxiety issue who won't shut up. Throughout the series, he basically shows no growth and stays as annoying as he did in Episode One. Its overplayed.

tt9335498,ur129950375,10,1 March 2021,"My review will be unbiased.People who say this anime is generic is all because of animation and nothing new. Those people sure have a personal grudge with this anime. Sure it has many things similar to other animes but there are much other unique stuff too. Besides, nowadays every new coming shonen anime is similar to other shonen animes in one way or another ( except old generation like naruto, dragon ball...etc) except storyline and Demon slayer's storyline is not generic.Now if I talk about Demon slayer, it is a multi-directional anime. It doesn't focus only on one element but all the different elements at the same time. For example thrill, action, comedy, drama, a very very little bit of romance and slice of life, mystery, dark etc. It's special not because of its storyline but the blend it creates by mixing thrill and emotions.Storyline:- if we take AOT's storyline as a reference Demon slayer's storyline is above average and simple with a lot of unexpected twists, turns and mystery.Characters:- This is one of the best things about demon slayer. As I said, demon slayer is an anime of emotions too it's every character hold different emotions. Example Hashiras characters. You can find from most calm to most angriest Hashira. You can find from most talkative to most silent Hashira. To be precise every character displays different emotions.Also, the reason for the protagonist to live on is not because he wants to take revenge like most of the shonen out there but to save his half-dead half-alive sister.If we talk about flaw; Demon slayer lacks storytelling. Its storyline has great potential but the way it is presented is very bad.Overall Demon slayer is a very great anime. All the hate you see for DS is a vocal minority while the majority is silent. Demon slayer has really a great successful future( I am a manga reader).",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur129950375/?ref_=tt_urv
tt9335498,ur130191415,10,8 March 2021,"Kimetsu no Yaiba is an anime that I revisited in 4 years. I saw people around me talking about and liking this anime. I watched without reading the synopsis or knowing the story before. Just hearing the name of the story that people are talking about. I watched with excitement. Tanjiro was just a normal lad. He is a gentleman very soft and gentle. But then his whole family was killed by a demon. I was shocked because his family was so sweet and warm. And his sister became a demon. Tanjiro loved his family very much. I'm quite sad Tanjiro tries a way to restore his sister to humanity. After that, Tanjiro had to work hard to train in order to become part of the Demon Slayer. And he was tested and served until met with friends Zenitsu and Inosuke. I like the characters of both of them. It's something that feels very new. A young boy like Zenitsu He is anxious and seems to cry all the time for fear. In my eyes it looks so funny and cute. But I secretly thought he look very scared and how could become a demon slayer. Inosuke a young man with a perfect body, big muscles and like to wear wild boar heads. He also likes to frantic . He is very reckless and doesn't like to be challenged by anyone. But feel full of heart when someone does something good or gives him something to eat. Is a very distinctive character.However, even though they have different personalities, they get along perfectly with each other. They do missions together.The story of each demon is interesting. It's a very good and interesting move. Makes me understand every character more and more. Everyone has a past. Each demon has a very bad and pitiful past. I cried so hard for their stories. After Episode 20 Met the people who were called pillars Each of them has a very distinctive character.After I finished watching, I found out that their story has not yet ended, this is only season1. So I went to find a manga (anime original) to read. And I came across a character that I love and love the most is Kanroji Mitsuri, in the anime that doesn't tell much about her. But with her loveliness and actions Make me fall in love with her.Demon Slayer is the best anime. Which you should not miss out on perfect and beautiful anime. Great art seen in every episode ,Beautiful scenes and scenery Everything is outstanding Never before seen, action scenes, effects, combat moves and original storyline. A story that is sad but has funny scenes too. With all emotions I am impressed by every character. But some the scenes are quite violent and without any censorship. Full view. If kids watching. I'd like to have parents introduce and watch together.To me, the Kimetsu no Yaiba is a truly unforgettable impression.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur130191415/?ref_=tt_urv

tt9335498,ur135593183,1,15 August 2021,"There is not a single redeeming quality about this anime, cliché plot, annoying characters with no depth, the dub voicing acting is just bad and every single episode is filled with 15 minutes of talking and repeating the same few sentences and back flashes, then finally a fight starts and it is ended almost instantly because all the characters have plot armour and are crazy OP despite being brand new demon hunters.Let me sum up all the characters right now..Tanjiro: Kind and OPNezuko: 'Cute' and fan service for weirdos who only watch the anime for an underage girl.Zenitsu: A coward with hidden power who cries a lot.Hashibira: Loud, violent, egotistical.That is all there is to these characters, they dont go any deeper then that.Also the animation may look nice, but then there are times where it switches to this hideous CGI that is just not needed and would look better if it kept with the original animation style, it really pulls you out of what you're watching.Too much time is spent simping over nezuko and talking about pointless things rather then developing the characters, the plot, the characters skills and abilities or fighting, which even then the fights would be boring because they're over so quickly, because the characters are just ridiculously strong (Which again makes no sense because they are brand new slayers).Dont watch this, it is not worth your time.EDIT: To prove my point in episode 17, one of the characters is running away and crying about how he cant fight, for 16 minutes and 50 seconds this goes on, and then he finally starts to fight, then at 17 minutes, 13 seconds the demon is dead. So that is almost 17 minutes of running around just generally being the most boring this I have ever watched, to some fancy animation, a flash of lightning and one strike, the demon dies. I cant even call it a 23 second fight because most of it is charging up the attack, a flash of lightning and then the demons head flys away.

tt9335498,ur146342218,10,4 December 2021,"One of Demon Slayer: Mugen Train's strongest elements is the way it successfully blends relatable emotional moments with real horror. The idea of wanting to stay in a soothing world where everything is perfect and happy is likely to strike a chord with most audiences (especially in pandemic times), and Sotozaki sticks a sharp knife into that with two inspired touches: the first is the extremely violent way Tanjiro learns to escape the dream state (don't try this at home, kids) and the second is the revelation that there's nothing Enmu likes better than awakening his victims out of their blissful dream state only to brutally murder them. That's proper dark, that is.Ultimately, if you're unfamiliar with the TV show, then watching Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is a bit like watching Avengers: Endgame without having seen any other Marvel movies - you can tell the good guys from the bad guys, you can enjoy the fight sequences, laugh at the jokes and be affected by the emotional scenes, but you'll miss the context and deeper significance of the character moments, as well as all the references, backstory and callbacks.",1,1,/user/ur146342218/?ref_=tt_urv

The action in this show is just enough to get your heart racing and wondering what will happen next. With an art style as beautiful as this one, it's hard to not fall in love with it. Along with the art, the characters are very relatable and loveable and you get to see them develop as they come across challenges they have to overcome.

tt9335498,ur149983331,4,16 February 2022,"So coming into this wildly recommended anime I was expecting quite the treat. After finishing Episode 10 I have to say this is quite a major disappointment.Animation - 9/10 Fantastic, I think shows like AoT are superior however.Story - 6/10 Typical revenge story. Love the concept, the execution is leaving much to be desired however.Writing - 2/10 Im sorry, but this is where this show fails. I have no idea how anyone can casually glance over how awful the story telling and writing are, but its honestly bizarre. There must be some very low standards in anime, but ive watched plenty with absolutely amazing writing, so I guess I just have no idea where anyone giving this a pass are coming from.The presentation of the first demon killed is randomly put forth. The guy basically trained this kid to kill this demon who has continuously killed his pupils and its just so randomly thrown together and done carelessly. So cutting the rock was a standin for the demons head, but the other kid cut it and it wasnt enough. It makes no sense, its that anime protagonist magic, but overdone to a laughable extent. ""He wins just because"". Awful.Every demon slaying thus far has gone about in exactly this order, Demon found, Demon has powers that protagonist couldn't possibly hope to rival, Protagonist literally pulls powers out of his butt to win fight. Yeah, really, thats how it goes. Theres no backstory to Water Forms at all, he just literally pulls it out of his butthole. Oh, and he hasn't only randomly, out of nowhere, mastered these water forms to the point he can constantly pull them off, theres 10 of them! And he knows them all! Where was this explained? Absolutely nowhere. Im sorry, this isn't passable writing. This is not caring. This isn't even trying. Do these power have rules? Is it infinite? Who knows! Its just being pulled out of a Chimpazees dirty diaper! This is worse than DBZ writing, at least I understood where Kaioken came from, the rules of it, and how hard it was to pull off. This show? Nothing.So yeah, thats the writing in a nutshell. Demon > Move pulled out of butt > Demon dead. Where am I supposed to care? The writers definitely didn't.Thats not even getting into the absolute ridiculousness of over stating the obvious to an extreme degree or the protagonist literally sitting afk, while a Demon regenerates, talking to himself. No one does this, this isn't a thing. No one screams and hollars over a bowl of soup. No one, not once.Oh and the major villain is Jack White. Yeah the guy from White Stripes. They apparently thought he made a cool final boss.Im honestly baffled anyone finds this appealing. If you want to watch an Anime that doesn't make you feel like your missing something, or that may put you off, id recommend Monster, Trigun, Attack on Titan, or Deathnote. If you are an avid watcher and want to see some cool animations with writing thats barely trying then this maybe your cup of tea.",2,3,/user/ur149983331/?ref_=tt_urv

tt11214590,ur20552756,6,29 November 2021,"There were quite a number of reasons for wanting to see 'House of Gucci'. The advertising did intrigue and did suggest a film that would be over the top but entertaining in its own way. Ridley Scott's filmography is hit and miss, brilliant at his best like with 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' though some of his films, such as 'GI Jane' and 'Robin Hood' ('Legend' is underrated in my view), are not too great. The main draw though was the cast, with Lady Gaga (an immensely gifted performer and inspirational person) being a big selling point for many.For me though, bigger selling points were seeing two of my favourite actors Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons again (and reunited after 'A Merchant in Venice'). Jared Leto has always been very take and leave. 'House of Gucci' turned out to be one of those difficult to rate and review sort of films for me, it is going to be one of those films that some are going to love and others are going to hate (with some in between). It is a hugely flawed film, but there was also a lot to enjoy at the same time. As far as Scott's films go, it's a middling effort. Neither one of his best or worst.'House of Gucci' has a lot that is good in my view. Have very little to complain about when it comes to how it looks, apart from some editing being in need of a tightening in the final act. The Italian scenery and the costumes are truly stunning though and the camerawork is similarly sumptuous. Scott's direction is uneven dramatically but is very impressive on a technical level, especially in his use of multiple cameras (which must make it easy for actors to know where to look). The soundtrack is also wonderful and beautifully operatic in scope, though not always well placed, but from a standalone point of view there are no complaints here.Despite the very all over the place accents, with a mix of exaggerated (Leto, to almost cartoonish effect in his case) or barely there (Irons, am a huge fan of Irons but will never deny about accents not being a forte of his), most of the acting is fine. Lady Gaga kills it as Patrizia, who is a very interesting and well fleshed out character here, bringing charm, effortless charisma and menace to her. It has been said that her accent isn't great, as far as the cast goes it's actually the most convincing one along with Salma Hayek's. Adam Driver is a good deal more understated, one of the few in the cast to play it very straight, but he is also compelling and his character growth/decent is believable. They have great chemistry together.The supporting cast on the whole support them well, Pacino coming off best having a whale of a time as Aldo. Irons brings vulnerability and authority to patriarch Rodolfo and Salma Hayek gives some of her best acting in years. Really liked the chemistry on the whole, Lady Gaga and Driver are great together as are Lady Gaga and Hayek, while that between Irons and Pacino is a joy. 'House of Gucci' does have a few great individual scenes, and one of the best is the magnificent encounter between Irons and Pacino. Personally thought the first half was fine and that it set up the intrigue and characters extremely well. As well as a few funny moments, Rodolfo's verbal brutalising of Paolo was gold and sums up the viewer's opinion of him and his work perfectly.On the other hand, 'House of Gucci' has a number of shortcomings. One performance didn't work for me and that was Leto. Unrecognisable in much talked about(the talk of social media when advertising was first revealed) makeup that deserves its own film, he overplays his role, especially when the comic relief becomes more dominant, and belongs in a completely different film. Yes the film is very over the top in tone, but Leto's performance veered on excess and too much of a Super Mario Brothers caricature. There are pacing issues, the rather underdeveloped family business stuff drags, sometimes to the point of stalling, due to the lack of tension and gravitas that was not there enough. And other parts come over as very choppy and incomplete feeling, like the final act. The second half needed a tightening up, which would have made the film less overlong (and it is a film that could have been 25 minutes shorter easily).Also found the ending very rushed and anti-climactic, handled with too much of an indifferent shrug. After spending so long on the family stuff (and not developing that enough) and the increasingly uneasy spurts of comedy, the event that caused such a sensation is just too throwaway in treatment. Tonally, 'House of Gucci' is messy, the comedy going for the campy approach that goes too far into pantomime in the second half and some of the serious moments being too melodramatic. Tonal shifts can be uneasily abrupt.The script has some funny and intriguing moments, but is on the whole too overwritten in tone (Leto's comedy increasingly gets too much), bland emotionally (the descent into revenge is not examined enough) and also too much of a trying to include as many iconic lines as possible. Some of the line delivery has to be heard to be believed, can imagine right now the amount of reaction gifs online in regard to some of the more comedic lines and Leto's body language.Concluding, hugely flawed but also quite fun when taking it for what it is. 5.5/10 (was struggling which score of 5 or 6 to give it but decided to go in between and round it up)",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv

He marries her anyways and his father disowns him.For me, this is all about the accent. Everybody is speaking English but in an overt Italian accent. It's distracting. As a story, I would concentrate more on the murder and the decline feels rushed. At least, it should be equal to the rest of the movie. Maybe this needs to be a limited series on a streaming service.

This is a real life version of Succession. In fact after having watched Joel Coen's The Tragedy of Macbeth, Shakespeare is the best source here.Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) is the humble outsider. A father runs a trucking company in Milan, something that might be associated with gangsters.Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) is the bookish lawyer who finds him ostracised by his father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons) when he marries her. Rodolfo is a former actor and half owner of the Gucci fashion brand and regards Patrizia as a gold digger.The company is operated by Uncle Aldo (Al Pacino) who brings Maurizio in from the cold. Aldo hopes that his influence on the couple would be useful after Rodolfo's death.Also's own son Paolo (Jared Leto) is a bit of an imbecile and regarded by everyone with disdain.The set up enables allows Patrizia to do her best Lady Macbeth act with the help of a flaky psychic. After the death of Rodolfo, she manipulates Maurizio to take over control of the company. Aldo is jailed for tax fraud and Paolo is just too dim to realise that he is being played.However eventually Maurizio tires of his grasping wife and feels guilty about stabbing his family in the back. So guilty he does it all over again.The film is loosely based on true facts. At times I was lost regarding when the events took place because the soundtrack was mainly from the 1980s.Scott though has directed the film with a mismatch of styles. It ranges from a straight drama with Driver giving an understated performance. To wildly kitsch with Leto being so outlandish, even Pacino cannot match him.Maybe Scott should had produced this as a longer mini series.

Having said that, I kind of understand where he is coming from. I reckon sometimes when I see German or Greek actors and I know what they say and how they say it, I may feel inclined to feel their performances are worse than those only going by the subtitles.But back to the beginning - well sort of. We start with what ultimately is the end - no pun intended. But we get back in time to introduce the complex character played by Lady Gaga. Now the character could also be called that, but I forgot her real name. In the beginning she may seem quite paper thin when it comes to her motivation and her goals. Some might say she stays that way, but I would respectfully disagree.While you could call her a gold digger in a sense, she is someone who sets goals for herself and does everything to achieve them. I would not call what she does sane - she is possessive, she is driven to say the least and she is extreme. So the movie while it is called Gucci and has more than stellar performances by all involved, is quite revolving around her character.No wonder she is not too happy about it - the real person Lady Gaga is portraying. Some of the others are not alive anymore (no pun intended here either), I am surprised the movie does not give us any insight on the daughter that Gucci had with his wife - everyone else is being mentioned and what their fate is/was.Now onto someone who I knew was in the movie - I even knew that he would look ... well not recognizable. And yet I almost had completely forgotten about him ... Jared Leto ... I mean his performance, the make up ... I'm telling you this has to get at least a nomination. Even his ""father"" Al Pacino didn't recognize him ... mind blowing to say the least.And coming back to performances, I understand if the Italian accents will throw you off ... a bit or more than that. Also quite the cliches in the beginning of the movie, that might make you sick or at least annoyed ... but once you get through that, the movie really is personal and quite addictive in its depiction of the people involved. Everyone with their own agenda - no pun intended. Some may seem aimless, but even they are human beings ... so many feelings hurt so many lives destroyed ... for what?

tt11214590,ur4248714,5,12 December 2021,"I saw the trailer and heard a lot of buzz about this film, mostly to be a contender for Awards Season the next year, it certainly looked like the kind of film that could receive nominations, and I was excited, directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, All the Money in the World). Based on the true story, young, attractive Italian woman Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) works as an office manager at her father's small trucking firm. At a party, Patrizia meets law student Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), the heir to half of the Gucci fashion house empire through his father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons). Maurizio is awkward, and Patrizia aggressively pursues him until he falls in love with her. Rodolfo warns Maurizio that Patrizia is only after him for his fortune and tells Maurizio that he will strike him from his will if he marries Patrizia. But Maurizio ignores this and leaves the Gucci family, choosing to marry Patrizia and taking a job at the Reggiani trucking company. When Patrizia becomes pregnant, she sees her child as a way to reconcile with the family. She lets it slip to Maurizio's uncle Aldo (Al Pacino) that she is pregnant; Aldo is delighted by the news and takes the couple under his wing. Aldo introduces Patrizia to his unintelligent son Paolo (Jared Leto), who aspires to be a designer within Gucci despite his lack of talent. Rodolfo becomes terminally ill, but thanks to Aldo, he and Maurizio reconcile shortly before his death. Maurizio was written back into Rodolfo's will, but Rodolfo did not sign the document transferring the Gucci shares to Maurizio before his death. Patrizia fakes Rodolfo's signature, giving Maurizio a 50% interest in Gucci. Aldo and Paolo hold the other 50% interest shares, and Patrizia starts devising a plot to obtain a controlling interest in Gucci by acquiring them. She clashes with Aldo over the firm's clandestine sale of cheap ""fake"" Gucci products on the black market. When starting her relationship with Maurizio, Patrizia made a call to television psychic Giuseppina ""Pina"" Auriemma (Salma Hayek) and has since been meeting and consulting her for guidance. Maurizio has little real interest in Gucci, but Patrizia Manipulates him into taking a more active role within the company. Paolo finds proof that Aldo has been evading taxes in the United States; he informs Patrizia of this in exchange for her promise that he will be allowed to design his own line. Aldo is arrested by the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) and sent to prison for a year. Patrizia lies to the Italian police and tells them that Paolo is not authorised to use the Gucci trademark; the police stop the fashion show by force. Patrizia and Maurizio ask Paolo to sell them his shares, but he abruptly rejects them and cuts ties between them. Italian police ransack Maurizio's house and attempt to arrest Maurizio for forging Rodolfo's signature. Maurizio and Patrizia flee to Switzerland, where Maurizio meets his old friend Paola Franchi (Camille Cottin). Maurizio and Patrizia have an argument, he has had enough of his wife's influence on himself and the company. He orders his wife and daughter to return to Italy and begins an affair with Paola, which Pina seemingly senses. When Maurizio's business plans harm the company, he seeks assistance from equity company Investcorp, through which he hatches a scheme to acquire shares of the company from a now-impoverished Paolo. When Aldo is released from prison, he immediately realises what Paolo has done. When Investcorp offers to buy Aldo out, he refuses until Maurizio reveals himself as the instigator of the deal. Dejected, Aldo sells the shares and cuts contact with Maurizio. Patrizia tries to reconcile with Maurizio, but he flatly ignores her. Later, Maurizio's long-time assistant Domenico De Sole (Jack Huston) informs Patrizia that he is asking for a divorce, but she refuses. Up-and-coming designer Tom Ford (Reeve Carney) is recruited by Maurizio to revitalise the company's image with a new line. Ford's products are successful, but Maurizio's mismanagement of the company has compelled Investcorp's leaders to buy him out, replacing him with Ford and De Sole. Patrizia eventually grows so furious with Maurizio that she asks Pina to help her kill him. Pina puts Patrizia in contact with some hitmen ""from Sicily"", and a few days later, Maurizio is shot to death in broad daylight outside his home. The epilogue details that Aldo died of prostate cancer and Paolo died in poverty shortly after selling their shares to Maurizio. Patrizia, Pina, and the hitmen were sentenced to long prison terms following their arrest for murder. Gucci was fully acquired by Investcorp and is a highly successful company in the present, but no Gucci family members remain at the company. Also starring Alexia Murray as Silvana Reggiani, Vincent Riotta as Fernando Reggiani, Youssef Kerkour as Nemir Kirdar, and Florence Andrews as Jenny Gucci. Gaga gives a fantastic performance going from lovestruck beauty to calculating gold-digger, Driver is alright, Pacino is splendid as the generous uncle, Irons is good as the creepy vampire-like father, and Leto is unrecognisable as the bald idiotic family member in an over-the-top showy performance. Many people will not be familiar with the story of the Gucci clan and all the scandal that made the news, it does keep your attention, but it is perhaps more style over substance, with the script being predictable at times, and the actors all put on Italian accents that vary in quality. But there are absolutely no complaints about the performances, Gaga being the standout, even Leto who is laughably ridiculous, the costumes, set design and use of colour is great, and the soundtrack of 70s and 80s hits (""I Feel Love"" by Donna Summer, ""Faith"" by George Michael"", ""Here Comes the Rain Again"" by Eurythmics"", ""Heart of Glass"" by Blondie) is engrossing, it is a little long, but a stylish looking and engaging biographical crime drama.

tt11214590,ur0806494,7,24 November 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. I've never purchased or owned anything Gucci, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying the heck out of Ridley Scott's film that brings the longest, most expensive and dangerous real life episode of 'Family Feud' to the big screen. It's co-written by Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna, and is based on the 2001 book, ""House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed"" by Sara Gay Forden. Brace yourself for a (mostly) true wild ride, and for what is likely to be one of the year's most divisive films - plenty of love and hate (just like the actual story).What happens when a brand is so closely associated with a family name? The arguments begin on who 'deserves' to be a Gucci, who is a 'real' Gucci, and who should make the decisions that impact the Gucci family and business wealth and reputation. During the extended run time (2 hours, 37 minutes), we see many of the iconic Gucci items: the Flora scarf, the moccasins, the bamboo bag, and the watches. And though high fashion is always present, director Scott has delivered a spectacle of romance, family riffs, extravagance, greed, power, betrayal, revenge, and crime.Lady Gaga (Oscar winner, A STAR IS BORN, 2018) stars as Patrizia, the newest Gucci. Hers is not blind ambition, but rather calculated and laser-focused. That she implodes a dysfunctional family is only a portion of the story. After marrying Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), Patrizia immediately begins manipulating her husband into reconciling with his family and taking on an active role in a business for which he previously had little interest. This is simply step two (the first was marriage) in her grand scheme to control the business and the money. Maurizio's father Rodolfo (Oscar winner Jeremy Irons, REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, 1990) is ailing, so it's Uncle Aldo (Oscar winner Al Pacino, SCENT OF A WOMAN, 1992) to whom Patrizia directs her attention. She plays it like a chess match - only this is more entertaining to watch unfold.Also in the picture is Paolo Gucci (a truly unrecognizable Jared Leto, Oscar winner, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB), Aldo's son, and a family outcast. Paolo is a wildly creative individual who tends to his pet pigeons and tries desperately to find his place in the family. Jack Huston plays Dominico De Sole, Rodolfo's consigliere and the family attorney. Each of the characters is given their time in the spotlight, including a terrific breakfast scene with Pacino and Irons. Of course this is mostly Patrizia's story, so it's Lady Gaga's performance that will attract much of the attention and commentary. I found her mesmerizing and twisted fun to watch as she proceeded with backstabbing and trickery. Driver's quietly intense approach makes the perfect contrast to hers.If you are familiar with the story, you know that Maurizio does eventually run the company, and he also tires of Patrizia's family-crushing antics ... which send him back into the arms of Paola Franchi (Camile Cottin, STILLWATER, 2021). This turns the campy and juicy melodrama factor up to 11 (on the Spinal Tap scale). Patrizia's frequent trips to fortune teller and TV psychic Pina Auriemma (Salma Hayek) cause a massive tonal shift in the film, leading to the well-documented conclusion. If all this isn't strange enough, Ms. Hayek is the real-life spouse of the CEO of Gucci's present-day parent company, Kering. Reeve Carney (""Penny Dreadful"") has a small, yet vital role as up-and-coming fashion designer Tom Ford.In this movie, it's easy to describe some performances as hammy or over-the-top, but that's likely to only hold as a first reaction. Leto's characterization of Paolo sticks out so much from the others ... but he was known as eccentric, and at best, was patronized by the family. It seems highly likely that his personality and approach stood in stark contrast to the old-school style of his father Aldo, or the more staid personalities of his Uncle Rodolfo and cousin Maurizio. Lady Gaga as Patrizia is cunning and shrewd in her calculated approach to re-structure the family and the business. She plays whatever games she must to get where she wants to be. I found her first half performance to be truly outstanding. Pacino is the actor who has trademarked hammy performances over the years, yet here, he fully grasps his role and character, and is a delight to watch.Much of this is documented by history, though the Gucci family claims not all is or was how it seems. Whether the boost in counterfeiting/knock-offs went down in the 70's and 80's as it's portrayed here, might be an area worth researching, but this is much less a case study in business principles as it is one in family dynamics. I'll certainly understand those who argue against the story structure here, but the entertainment value proved to be enough for me. As the Gucci tagline goes, ""Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten"", but the backstabbing and disloyalty is never forgotten - despite providing great theater (and fashion).Opens in theaters on November 24, 2021.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur0806494/?ref_=tt_urv

Then enter Al Pacino as Uncle Aldo, Rodolfo's brother who perhaps as a reaction to his poor relationship with his own idiot son Paolo (Jared Leto) himself a misguided would-be fashion designer who has as much talent and flair as a used match, takes a shine to the disowned couple and brings them into the family business. Big mistake!Pacino of course doesn't do quiet anymore and immediately he appears, makes a beeline for the scenery to sink his teeth into it. From there, the plot thickens as the company fortunes slip and the family control diminishes. Eventually too, Maurizio tires of Patrizia and leaves her for a young blonde he meets on the ski-slopes which act proves to be the decisive one in pushing his estranged wife over the edge to hatch her murder plot.Maybe it's just the subject matter of the fashion world that doesn't interest me much, but I found it difficult to be much engaged by the lifestyles of the rich and famous depicted here. Gaga works hard, maybe too hard, as the upwardly mobile Patrizia but Driver seems to get by a lot with just his goofy smile behind his character's oversized glasses.At nearly three hours long, it seemed to me to me as if a sharp pair of scissors were needed to cut this feature down to a more manageable length. As it was, I will confess to nodding off more than once at the lack of dramatic tension on the screen.Sometimes these dramatised retellings of real-life events work well as movies while some are better served as straight documentaries.

tt11214590,ur4234119,7,24 November 2021,"After watching ""House of Gucci"", I know ambition and the thirst for gold can be so fiercely boundless they would drive anyone to the most extreme corners. I could believe it thanks to the performance of... Jared Leto!How he transformed himself into Jeffrey Tambor's clone is already an achievement in transformation, but Leto wanted more, he wanted the golden statuette and when you're in the supporting department surrounded by Jeremy ""Scar"" Irons and Al ""Scarface"" Pacino as patriarch brothers Rodolfo and Aldo Gucci, it's a whole new level of over-the-top that you've got to reinvent.Leto's embodiment of Aldo's worthless son Paolo is the kind of self-deprecating prowess to be seen to be believed. Trust me: he might have been a mediocre designer but every single scene with him was designed as an Oscar clip. Every second of each moment with Leto contains a mimic, a look, a grimace, a dancing, a crazy laugh, anything begging us to notice him... and only him. Leto is the film's scene-stealer.In fact, he doesn't steal the show but the whole movie, all the pathos invested in that performance, making Fredo Corleone look like Al Capone, is one of the most joyously campy performances I've seen since ""Mommie Dearest"" and I I hated him... not because he was bad, but because he was so desperately good at stealing the show he might have stolen Al Pacino's chances to get his tenth Oscar nomination.Yes, I'm a Pacino fan and he was the reason I couldn't wait for the film, but ever since the second trailer's release, he didn't seem to get any attention although I believe he deserves a few praises. Anyway, I have nothing against Leto getting an Oscar nomination as long as Pacino pulls a Joe Pesci in ""The Irishman"". And both bring so much life in what could have been a rather grim story that the way I see it, either you award both or no one.. well, except for the Razzies.Sorry to fill the review with awards talk but let's not kid ourselves, this is a star-studded biopic released at the end of the year... ever since the project was announced, everyone was waiting for Thanksgiving and not for Black Friday but the Black widow plated by Lady Gaga. Fans are already lobbying for her Oscar win this time (the nomination is obvious). And you know what, they're right! Adam Driver effaces himself magically as a passive, undecided, husband too nice to be a lawyer let alone venturing in the jungle-like fashion world... with a lionness for a wife.And so the real Driver is Patrizia Reggiani, a fiercely ambitious woman who once landed her eyes on Maurizio knew she would marry him. In fact, once she knew his surname. Gaga's performance is a masterstroke of subtltety, notice how her look shifts when Maurizio says ""Gucci"", perhaps 75% of his charm, her courting is certainly the best example of a woman playing easy-to-get and yet there's something genuinely sincere in her act that contradicts the way the trailer exposed her as a villain. She's venal all right, but that doesn't prevent her from truly loving her husband and wishing to elevate him. Alas, she realizes very quickly that the curse of the Gucci family is just as if the Corleone had only Fredos in charge. Maurizio, is more Hagen-like, he who's definitely not cut for business wartime.But Patrizia, what a woman! And Gaga is so natural in that role that I noticed she didn't just have the talents, but the looks as well. After that and ""A Star is Born"", I wish she could drop the whole Gaga extravaganza and be herself, it's not just in the film, she has something of Liz Taylor. In other words, she's a natural. And she's so good that she makes the film's flaws more apparent. Forget about Leto's clownish manners, forget about Pacino, Pacino's good, problem's pacing.That's where the film doesn't play in the league of Ridley Scott's classics, he seems to have shot the film quickly to match the holiday schedules. Fair enough but the editing suffered a little, some scenes cut abruptly, the transition of Aldo Gucci from an ally to a liability feels odd. But the real problem is the way Patrizia turns into a supporting character during the third act. Some critics pointed that the film is too long, I would nuance that statement, it takes so much time building the relationship that the film can't afford her disappearance for too long. Yes, it's that pint-sized lady that carries the film more than all the other male-cast combined (even Salma Hayek is totally overshadowed by her aura)There are some good performances in the last act with honorable mentions to Jack Huston, Youssef Kerkour and to a lesser degree, Camille Cottin who's given an even more thankless role than Driver... but there's too much elements slowing down the film instead of building up its way to the deadly climax. For all the efforts pulled by Gaga, the ending seems anticlimactic and needlessly depressing while it needed a little cynical edge to it. What it does get with the final line and obligatory 'where are there now?'.Anyway, if people compared the film to ""The Godfather"" I think it's closer in spirit to ""Goodfellas"" and all these period films that use timely pop songs to bring the musical texture of the era. I won't speak of the accents but sometimes Scott insist a little too much on the ""Italian"" factor and that comes from an opera fan. Anyway, to stay in that spirit, let me say: ""Veni. Vidi. Gucci"". I came, I saw, I didn't yawn, I might have cringed here and there but overall, I enjoyed it.It could have been better but let me tell you this film will still be remembered in a few decades, I'd bet my annual salary... which wouldn't buy one pair of Gucci's second-hand socks.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur4234119/?ref_=tt_urv

But it can always be assumed that it will be a quality film, an interesting and well-filmed story, a film that will attract talented and prestigious actors. 'House of Gucci' is no exception from these points of view. With a formidable cast and a passionate story, inspired by real events that took place in the fashion empire that is the House of Gucci, a story that combines luxury, passion and crime, 'House of Gucci' did not disappoint me at all .I confess that I am very little interested and almost completely ignorant in terms of fashion and big fashion houses. 'House of Gucci describes exactly the history of such an institution, but fortunately for me it is less about the aesthetics of fashion, although the film tries to say something about the conflicts between the classic lines and modernity, between the unique pieces designed to satisfy the fantasies of the world's rich and mass production, as well as about the fate of the family businesses in an extremely competitive economy in which almost any means excuses the purposes of commercial success and profitability. However, the focus is on the family relationships between brothers Aldo (Al Pacino) and Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons) who had inherited and developed the business founded by their father and ran it together in the '80s, and their sons Maurizio (Adam Driver) and Paolo ( Jared Leto). In the family also enters Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) whose relationship with Maurizio seems at first to be a beautiful love story that breaks down social barriers. However, the family conflicts and the personal relations between the five characters will take a dramatic turn.Ridley Scott knows how to bring complex stories to screen and to nail in chairs his spectators in movies that last more than two and a half hours. This succeeds in this case as well. 'House of Gucci' is fluent and cinematically consistent. The distribution is top notch and only the sequence of names on the generic would be enough to justify paying the admission ticket. The acting performance that seemed extraordinary to me is that of Lady Gaga. I had greatly appreciated her acting performance in 'A Star Is Born' and hoped that she would confirm her value as an actress even in movies where she does not sing. My expectations were met. In the role here,Lady Gaga proves that she is a formidable actress, who brings life to the characters she enters, who creates roles different from each other and especially from the one she plays in life. Her Patrizia Reggiani, the beautiful, lovingly, ambitious, unscrupulous girl from the people, reminded me all the time while watching Anna Magnani. Al Pacino is also excellent in a consistent role of a character who goes through upheavals of destiny. We can only regret that Jeremy Irons does not have an equally solid role, but the time we see him on screen is a delight. Salma Hayek also shows up in a supporting role, one of her most interesting lately. Turning to the disappointments, I start with Adam Driver, who for the first time after many movies puzzled me, seemed more indecisive than his hero and failed to clarify who was this character who climbs to the top of the pyramid constantly looking like he wants to be somewhere else and do something else. Finally, Jared Leto seemed to me to exaggerate in the transformations of physiognomy and in the comic features that he attributed to his character.This film could very well have been an Italian film, the language in which most dialogues are supposed to take place. Does it lose credibility by being spoken English sometimes adding, not very justified I would say, Italian accents to the English spoken by some characters. Of course, the Italian film would have been very interesting, but it would have had a different perspective, and I think the issue of authenticity is a false one. A movie is a movie. Ultimately, we don't care if 'Spartacus' should have been played in Latin or 'The Last Duel' in medieval French. 'House of Gucci' is a great studios film that takes place mostly in Italy and which does not try to pretend that it is something else. I think we're lucky to have Ridley Scott with us in the ninth decade of his life, full of energy and desire to make movies. Let's enjoy him!",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur0547823/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur20018357,CinemaCl,2 February 2022,"A film so out of its mind that it is operating entirely on impulses, House of Gucci makes for a wild, inconsistent & unabashedly over-the-top biographical crime drama that chronicles the downfall of the Gucci family dynasty without any intent or interest and is surprisingly fuelled by absolutely unhinged performances, each functioning on a separate wavelength and pointed in a different direction.Directed by Ridley Scott, this tonal nightmare plays out like an (un)intentional parody of the Oscar-bait biopics and is far from the quality of work we expect from the filmmaker at helm. All its elements are at odds with each other, thus resulting in a film so bonkers & unpredictable in its approach & execution that it actually piques the curiosity in a way that's not just unusual or unexpected but also nonsensical.However, a story treatment this uneven & erratic can only carry on for a while before the appeal goes away and this one goes on for 157 long minutes, all of which is tediously paced. The characters themselves are mere caricatures and the ensemble cast is given the license to render them as such. But none of the actors are ever on the same level or looking for any kind of harmony even when sharing screen together.Overall, House of Gucci is inarguably the ""so bad it's good"" film of the year. Laced with irony, drowning in decadence and incongruous in each n every aspect, this overlong & overbearing train-wreck suffers from issues of its own makings and despite boasting an A-list ensemble, it doesn't utilise a shred of their talents. Inadvertently hilarious & downright mediocre, Ridley Scott's latest is what happens when the entire cast n crew is left unsupervised & goes amok.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv

tt11214590,ur1606763,harry_tk_y,9 February 2022,"This 158-minutes ""crime; drama"" (per IMDb) has its moments but is on the whole only good, not great, and not among Ridley Scott's better works.The narrative of the story based on high Italian fashion starts with the meeting of the protagonists Patrizia Reggiana (Lady Gaga) and Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) at a high fashion party. ""Wanna dance?"" she ask. ""No"" he say, politely. The next shot shows them on the dance floor, she enthusiastically, he awkwardly. A series of courtship sequences culminates at the climax crescendo in Libiamo (the signature aria of La Traviata) in the background, simultaneous with Patrizia's outburst in orgasm on screen. The montages then cut briskly to Patrizia in wedding gowns.I have left out a thing or two in these fast-paced establishing scenes. Essentially, Maurizio's business guru father Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons), considering Patrizia a gold-digger, allows everything except marriage. Son rebels; father cuts off all financial support. Maurizio suspends his pursuit of a law degree to work in Patrizia's father's truck company, and is as happy as a lark there, especially when boss becomes father-in-law. ""I don't have their (meaning Gucci's) Tuscan character"", declares Maurizio, and claims with pride his mother's German blood.""What is this?"" is the great Al Pacino's opening line, playing Uncle Aldo Gucci looking at the newspaper announcement of the wedding. While not exactly on good terms with his brother, Aldo offers to help reconcile Maurizio to his father. In the meantime, displaying warm parental affection for his new niece-in-law, Uncle Aldo takes the couple under his wings, offering Maurizio the position of ""Gucci world affair coordinator"" while both agree that the job description would be pretty vague.Now we are shown the other pair of uncle and nephew, Rodolfo and Aldo's son Paolo (Jared Leto), whose incompetence appears to be legendary in the Gucci family. Trying to make a pitch to Uncle Rodolfo to support his artistic endeavors, Paolo is rejected offhand.We are an hour into the movie and the fun hasn't even started yet. It starts with the demise of Rodolfo. Family feud erupts, on all fronts. Most intimately, Patrizia resents Maurizio's undermining her when he says ""My name, not yours"" when she invokes ""Gucci"". Without missing a beat, she retorts ""Our name"", flashing her wedding ring. The couple gets over this little hiccup quickly as they agree ""Aldo and Paolo are poison. They have to go"". Soon enough, Aldo get a year's prison sentence for tax laws and other violations. Paolo gets into trouble for copyright matters.The last 60 minutes of the movie turns dark as husband and wife turned against each other. At the end of the movie, how each of the characters ended up is detailed by on-screen text. The final, punchy line, intimates that today's Gucci, a listed company, does not involve anyone with the name of Gucci.With the just-announced Oscar nomination, Gucci is at the top of the ""snubbed"" list, with a solitary nomination for makeup.",0,2,/user/ur1606763/?ref_=tt_urv

tt11214590,ur8462477,4,7 February 2022,"In 2021 legendary British director Ridley Scott made a great drama starring Adam Driver and it wasn't called House of Gucci.Releasing mere months on from his unfortunate box office dud The Last Duel, easily one of Scott's best films in decades, Gucci appeared on paper to be a likely heavy hitting Oscar contender and while it's likely to receive some Oscar spotlight thanks to its best asset Lady Gaga's solid turn as Patrizia Reggiani, Gucci is a dull and lifeless dialogue driven family drama based around true life events that occurred in the famous Gucci family in the 1980's.With its loaded based on reality plot and a name brand cast that many prestigious dramas would kill to get, Gucci should've been something special when one considers that talent in front of and behind the camera but this often tiresome two and a half hour epic (that really didn't need to be as long as it was when delivered this way) struggles to provide its audience with a single special element as it follows Reggiani and her new husband Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver in one of his more mid-tier leading turns) through their ups and downs as Gucci heirs.Feeling like nothing more than a procession of endless scenes with actors chewing on dialogue, none more so than a Razzie worthy prosthetic clad Jared Leto who appears to have arrived to the set thinking his in an entirely different film, as his over the top Paolo Gucci waltzes around clambering for attention, Gucci has no heart or soul within its cold delivery that extends to Scott's workmanlike direction that's content in just being there rather than creating any type of cinematic magic or spark.As the man in charge, much blame for Gucci's dry delivery and unexciting procedural nature falls at the feet of Scott who showed so recently with The Last Duel that his still capable after all these years in the industry of making features like the best of them can, making this forgettable and perhaps too self-assured outing all the more disappointing when one ponders just what may've been had all the ingredients here come together in the way all film fans would've hoped for them to do.Final Say -Outside of Lady Gaga an A-list cast can't breathe life into a laborious and unimaginative drama based around some fascinating true life characters. With a distracting Jared Leto only making matters worse, House of Gucci is a big step backwards for Scott after the effort he made with The Last Duel.2 scarves out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur8462477/?ref_=tt_urv

tt11214590,ur0715971,2,13 December 2021,"Taste is, of course, a unique thing. As I write this review ""House of Gucci"" has a score of 6.9 which is baffling to me, as the film I sat through last Saturday was an unmitigated disaster. One that's story is too boring to even allow you to enjoy the hilariously bad performances.Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) meets Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) at a party. Maurizio is the son of Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons) who owns 50% of the family named fashion chain. Initially training to be a lawyer, Patrizia, along with his uncle Aldo, (Al Pacino) encourages Maurizio to join the family business. Very quickly, lines of division are drawn, and alliances and double crosses push Maurizio to the head of the company.I am not the first person to come here and make fun of some of the performances. Adam Driver and Lady Gaga can leave with their reputations relatively unscathed, even if perhaps Gaga hones an accent that's a bit more Transylvanian than Milanese. Al Pacino and Jared Leto though are in a different film, with broad comedic performances that make the Dolmio adverts look like Mike Leigh in comparison.I could, perhaps, forgive their choices if the overall film hung together better, but alas it doesn't. The story is glacial at some points, but at others either skips over or brushes through sections that are required to make the story make sense. Why do the police come after Maurizio as quickly as they do? How does the information about Aldo's taxes make it to the American authorities? What does Maurizio actually do, once he's taken control? Why does he abandon his wife and child after one brief argument? The story needs Patrizia to be Lady Macbeth, subtly twisting and cajoling her unwilling husband to power, before he turns on her and she extracts revenge. Instead though, Maurizio's whole personality changes in a moment, without that much justification, and he moves on without her. Also, I never really had the right feel for how much time has passed between scenes, and I'm not helped by the score, which seems to use anachronistic songs, but at others tries to evoke the period.In lesser hands, this might be more forgivable, but this is Ridley Scott and we've come to expect more.

Patricia pursues Maurizio and it's not long before he falls for her. He introduces Patricia to his dad Rodolfo, who warns Maurizio that she is after the Gucci money... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from veteran director Ridley Scott, now a crisp 84 years young. This film, adapted from the non-fiction book of the same name, has been in development hell for over a decade and that typically does not bode well for a film. On the other hand, when you see the level of talent that is attached to this production, it left me intrigued. On top of all that, I was unaware of all the underlying plot details. As the film started playing out, it quickly became apparent to me that what we have here is an honest to good soap opera of an intra-family feud and a correlating complicated romantic relationship between Patricia and Maurizio. Let's just say that, yes, there is a LOT of drama. Much has been said about Lady Gaga's performance (as Patricia), and she certainly brings a strong performance. But Adam Driver (as Maurizio) is absolutely amazing. Jeremy Irons (as Rodolfo) plays it close to the vest. In contrast, Al Pacino (as Aldo, the other 50% owner of Gucci) lays it all out there and holds nothing back. The only false note in the cast is Jared Leno (as Paulo, Aldo's son), whose performance is way, way over the top and feels unauthentic. At just short of 2 hrs. 40 min., the movie is frankly too long for its own good, and could've benefited from a tighter edit. In the end I quite enjoyed it for what it was: a good ol' fashioned family drama that plays out like a sensational soap.""House of Gucci"" opened in US theaters on the long Thanksgiving weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended just so-so (about 15 people). Unless this movie somehow generates a lot of year-end award nominations, I don't see having this long legs in theaters. For that the movie is simply not strong enough (although it certainly isn't a ""bad"" movie).

tt11214590,ur22956348,8,17 February 2022,"House of Gucci is an epic drama clocking in at two hours and thirty-eight minutes that portrays the rise and fall of the Gucci dynasty. The story revolves around Patrizia Reggiani, a young woman of modest origin who has never worked in her whole life. When she meets Maurizio Gucci at a party, she seduces the inexperienced youngster and manipulates him into going out on dates with her. As she becomes his girlfriend, she starts influencing her boyfriend regarding certain business decisions. As they get married, Maurizio Gucci gets estranged from his grumpy father Rodolfo Gucci who doesn't appreciate Patrizia Reggiani and grows closer to his ambitious uncle Aldo Gucci and his mentally challenged cousin Paolo Gucci. Patrizia Reggiani pushes her socially awkward husband to become more ambitious as she wants the business to expand internationally. However, her domineering attitude soon starts having negative impacts on her mariage. When Maurizio Gucci decides to leave and eventually divorce her, Patrizia Reggiani is planning her gruesome revenge.This very good drama convinces on numerous levels. First of all, the acting performances are truly outstanding. Adam Driver, one of the most exciting contemporary American actors, incarnates the shy heir who becomes a relentless businessman very convincingly. Jared Leto is absolutely stunning as mentally challenged heir whose talents are often ignored and who is constantly mistreated by his family members. The shining star of this movie however is Lady Gaga who perfectly incarnates the greedy femme fatale who becomes an insatiable black widow. The way she dresses, looks at other people and speaks to others will send shivers down your spine. It's easy to imagine how a young naive businessman could fall under her spell.Since this is a movie about a high-end luxury fashion house portrayed from the early seventies until the late nineties, this movie features magnificent accessories, dresses, jewelry, shoes and suits. The film also shows wonderful cars, elegant mansions and breathtaking locations all around the world. The bright cinematography with excellent lighting techniques is best enjoyed on the big screen.The film's greatest strengths are its character developments and story. What almost starts like a fairy tale as a young woman of modest origin meets a charming young millionaire gradually turns into an abusive, dramatic and horrifying relationship that is quickly spiralling out of control. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat until the climactic ending.There are few flaws to mention. The movie obviously has a few minor lengths in the middle section that might drag on for far too long. Instead, it would have been interesting to briefly show the fates of the uncle and the cousin instead of describing it in two sentences as the very end of the movie.House of Gucci is a wonderful drama with excellent acting performances, intriguing characters, tense plot development and wonderful settings. It goes to show that money can'y buy everything and especially won't make you happy. This movie portrays how greed, jealousy and power manipulate the human mind as people quickly forget who they actually are, where they come from and what they are wishing for. This story is worth being told and should go down as one of the most critically acclaimed movies of this decade.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur22956348/?ref_=tt_urv

tt11214590,ur40547513,8,29 November 2021,"House of Gucci: Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) wasn't solely responsible for the fall of the House of Gucci but she certainly helped. Like a force of nature she hooks Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) when Maurizio's father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons) disowns him she wins over the uncle, Aldo (Al Pacino). When Maurizio is reconciled with the dying Rodolfo and inherits his shares in Gucci she turns on Aldo and his hapless son Paolo (Jared Leto). Forging signatures on share certificates results in police attention, When Maurizio tires of her she decides to remove him from the equation. Wonderful settings in Milan and the Italian countryside, palatial villas and apartments. Gaga is a convincing conniver as Patrizia whose low cunning is just not good enough in the end to conquer all. Salma Hayek is the mysterious medium Giuseppina Auriemma, Patrizia's confidante, consigliere and co-conspirator, when her spells don't work on Maurizio she turns to Sicilian contacts. The Guccis (both young and old) though were tax-dodgers and spendaholics who would have eventually brought down their business through their own antics. The third generation, Maurizio being a good frontman but not a manager; Paolo inept but full of delusions of his own artistic abilities; could endure the attentions of neither Patrizia nor investment funds.

tt11214590,ur1090944,5,29 November 2021,"Based on true events usually means that the true events are fictionalized and made more spectacular. Since I am Italian, I already knew what happened between Patrizia Reggiani and Maurizio Gucci, because at the time their lurid story occupied headlines in national newspapers. The real story seemed to have gone more or less as described, with Patrizia being a vulgar gold digger, who used to consult fortune tellers and ended up hiring her killer via her ""clairvoyant"" BFF, once Maurizio dumped her.Lady Gaga nails the part, probably thanks to her natural arrogance, and she looks a lot like a prettier version of the real Patrizia; Driver is bland as usual, although his part probably called for a weak character; Pacino is a tad more subdued than usual, which is much appreciated but Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci is unbearable, more than an eccentric Italian he does a version of what an American considers typical Italian, missing completely the mark and spoiling it further with a dreadful accent.Even if costumes and locations are generally OK, the soundtrack is extremely sloppy, as if nobody could be bothered to do some research and produce a soundtrack suitable to the time and place. Instead, they took the shortcut of going for Italian opera, the trite soundtrack of choice for movies with Italian characters, even if by now is super outdated; a couple of Italian songs from the Sixties sounded totally wrong because the film takes places in the Eighties and a few disco hits blasted on incongruously at the wrong time... totally not an Italian atmosphere, unless you think in Italy time stopped with La Dolce Vita, or even earlier with Verdi.Apart from the dreadful soundtrack, some parts (mainly all those with Leto) dragged on too long and dragged the movie down.PS in the first third of the film Maurizio Gucci is jumping wildly inside one of the shops and stopping in a freeze-frame that we discover right at the end, belongs to a photo shooting with Avedon.

tt11214590,ur25226117,8,24 November 2021,"LIKES:The Setting:
It's amazing to say the least, a crafted world of history brought back to life with the amazing budget Hollywood brings with it. House of Gucci drops us back to the 1970s and 80s, and brings the energy of the world with it in the form of buildings, clothes, cars, and practically everything else. All the culture is fun to relive, and seeing the transitions of Patrizia, alongside the family, during these time periods really helped with the immersion into the story, which I find important in a movie like this.The Costumes and Makeup:
If you are doing biographies, you've got to have the look of the characters as well in order to really bring the movie home. Again, well done on this movie, for the makeup has indeed turned our actors into the reflections of the Gucci family. The extra layers of skin, the changes in body structure, alongside an ever changing profile as they age was incredible to watch over the run time. It's great attention to detail and worthy of recognition at the award shows for the amazing execution of capturing the look. Complementing that is the costume work that they pulled into this movie, and the high profile our characters model. House of Gucci is about a fashion empire, and they dress the part with lavish outfits that are fancy, but not to the point of being obscene. Looking at a few of the historical picks, the mimicry of the styles was beautifully recreated and incorporated, using the clothes as a statement and weapon to represent the name of Gucci. Ten points for the incredible work that they did in this form.The Music:
A sucker for a good soundtrack, House of Gucci accomplishes this goal for me by picking A list songs from the time period they were in. While that's not hard to accomplish in the golden age of music, Gucci's director of music impressed me with the selection for the scenes and how well the songs represented the moment. Heart of Glass for a romantic sequence that is very fragile is not only toe tapping, but a great reflection of the mindset, while Faith (which is modern) manages to work itself into the mix for describing the wedding of the two at the start. It's a cute way of bringing that extra factor to the mix, and I was very happy with the results that we got, including a little Italian classics to sneak in as well.The Pace:
I feared it would be awful, but Scott seems to have found a nice balance of moving and storytelling that accomplished the goal of the drama genre. There are enough fun parts to help break up the monotony, and he does a nice job guiding you through the complicated sea of business to help you embrace the storm. Yet, the drama is very well mixed in, and manages to take the magnitude of a Soap Opera and curtail it to quality work worthy of the theater. This is not easy to do for a reviewer like me, but Scott again succeeded in the strategic story telling with his screenplay group.The Acting:
Are we surprised this is my favorite component? Don't be, because this all-star cast did a great job hitting their marks in this tale of dark dealings. Gaga is stunning as Patrizia, combining her seductive and dark nature from AHS: Hotel but upping the game to the levels we saw in a Star is Born. The accent is neither out of the park or bad, but she utilizes it decently to belong in the world, while letting her mannerisms, facial acting, and attitude drive the bus of the antagonistic role. She sells the malice well, and conveys the greedy side we got from the trailers to an art that was scary good. Adam Driver was my favorite of the group, once again meshing into his character and becoming one with the look and feel of Gucci. A complicated role that required capturing the air of the man, Driver succeeds on so many levels that convey his commitment to the role. I love his transitions in character, his ability to gradually change the nature of his character and show the emotions that come with the changes to his life. He was charming, he kept in balance, and I loved seeing the struggles he had to face in finding himself. As for Pacino, the man's transformation in character was stunning to say the least, but wow did he bring the uncle who tried to be the bridge beautifully. I had fun with his role, and really felt like he was the fun uncle that people loved and was a lifeblood of the Gucci family. He was utilized well into the film, and though not the central character, really played the part to the level I think they wanted.DISLIKES:A Few Slow Points
The pace is better than I expected, but not perfect and there are times when House of Gucci takes a little detour to the slow side. A few side conversations here, a few shots of sex there, and you get this small inconsistency that was like a gnat flying around to occasionally get in your way. Gucci managed to keep it mostly trimmed to the point, but I can't say there were not moments that could have been substituted for something else.The Selection of Scenes
Gucci's history must be pretty extensive, and I think they got the premise of the movie as a whole to covey the power war that was within that family for much of the film. However, I can't help but think that they could have picked better scenes to denote the corruption and destruction that we were seeing. Some of the moments seem a little to day-to-day life, and some liberties could have been taken with seeing Patrizia's workings in the family. Instead of seeing a couple of raunchy sex scenes, we could have sacrificed a few to perhaps show more planning or her indulging into the lifestyle that she ""drinks"" in so to speak. Again, there is enough cohesion to give you the picture in the fine feast of drama, but still there were elements that could have been doctored to give us that more fitting drama the world has become addicted to.More Time With Other Characters:
Again, I get who this is about and what it involves in the dance of destruction that Patrizia and Maurizio perform in this film. Yet when loading up a family drama, I had hoped other characters might have been used a little more or in a different manner than what we got. Jeremy Irons' character has some introducing starts, but then sort of fades to the back burner, hostilities between Jared Leto's character start out strong, but that too fell to mediocrity, lacking the full Scott package I l myself like to see. This goes back to the buffet of the story we had, but some of the things picked did not feel fully thought out or utilized with the dramatic spin they could have done. Even if the events had been made up and we got Patrizia doing more with them, I might have felt the full performance promised in the trailers.Did We Get The Full Malice Factor of Patrizia:
Gaga gives a great performance for me and again is impressive in her acting ability evolution, but the direction of the film may not have taken the full liberties of the malice her character could have brought. Certainly there are plenty of moments, especially in the dialogue, where she presents the greed she is addicted too. Yet, there could have been a lot more with the girl who pulled so many strings to guide the Gucci's to their status. A few side deals perhaps? More of her lavish spending and control of finances? A combination of things could have been chosen, but alas, I did not feel we got the full package of the plague that she was.The Time Jumps:
For me, the part that seems to have gotten in the way of the film the most was the time lapses that this thing did for meeting the attention span of the audience. House of Gucci puts a lot of history into the film, but then sort of fast forwards through the years in the quest for the ultimate fate. There are times where it executes it well, but there are times where I think the skips have denied the full potential of the characters to come out and/or dropping the acts that I had expected to be seen by Scott's direction. Again, it's not horrible for the most part, but I can't help but think there is a director's cut to be released to give us more for home viewing that may address this problem. This is especially true with the ending, which does put the final bow on the whole package, but is in a scene that feels very big budget for the little it does, when a simple picture montage with words could have done the same thing.The VERDICT:
House of Gucci has the style, the class, and the cultural lifestyle that Scott is famous for injecting into his films. Utilizing a sensational mix of style, setting, and costumes, he has brought the essence of the fashion empire to life and unleashed the desire to dive into the products and history of this family. With fantastic music to further paint the picture and acting that really shines for most of the cast, this dramatic biography gets lots of Oscar nods towards several of the big categories of fashion. Yet, in terms of story, there feels that more needs to be done to fully get the malice promised in that trailer. Perhaps it's due to time constraints and the cornucopia of information the nearly two decades held with them. Maybe, it was budget and Covid constraints that led to cuts in order to maximize profit? Yet it could be the source material and trying not to go too far down the movie magic hole. I don't know, but something is off in the time lapses and inconsistent details that does not destroy the film, but also limits the potential. Perhaps we will get a director's cut in the future, but until then, the film is definitely worth a visit to the theater for quality drama.My scores for the film are:

Not a lot happens & when it does it's not great, the pay off just isn't there. At 2 hours & 31 minutes, this film is stupidly long & has terrible pacing issues. A lot of scenes could've easily have been cut out & did nothing but drag the film out. 30-40 minutes easily could've been exercised from this film as well as some added action, yes I know the film is a drama about the real life clothing company but come on, you need to keep the audience investigated otherwise it just falls apart.But aside from that, the story was interesting enough, the eye candy was ace with Lady Gaga & some of the scenery was nice too.Overall, it's a long film that's mostly boring & lacks impact of action, aside from some eye candy & a few scenes, the film sadly fails.3/10.",46,71,/user/ur31117020/?ref_=tt_urv

This movie had multiple problems with perhaps the most glaring one being the main lead was missing in action ""Gucci"", where was the glamour, the fashion, the branding, the fashionistas, all this buzz was absent and we were left with an Italian family arguing about spaghetti!About 45 mins in to a glacial 2 hours and 37 minutes, the whole thing sagged, it was baggy and lugubrious and lost all dramatic impetus, there was little script to speak of so it must be the editing, someone needs sacking!Now drilling down to specific woes:A movie like this cannot rest on the TV acting method style of Lady Gaga, it is so unfair to her, as it is way beyond her range. (less is more). I would have suggested that Salma Hayek and Lady Gaga should have swapped places, this might have worked. I don't mean to be overly critical but two crucial things are missing in Lady Gaga's acting, firstly the high polished surface and characterisation is sterile artifice, as there is just nothing in the eyes, it is emotions by wrote and numbers, secondly there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Adam Driver. This is a repeat of a Star is Born we saw the same sterility with Bradley Cooper.The script was awful, nothing happened, well make something happen, if you can't, then you haven't got a movie script or indeed a movie!The music, what a disaster.What was brilliant, Al Pacino and Jared Leto, wow is all I can say, they just bounced off each other, with pathos and comic timing. Adam was good but his range was limited in this role.Ok, overall this is a very weak 6 outta 10, I was bored, I fidgeted, I thought when will it ever end, I thought I've seen Lady Gaga's ""A"" face and even ""B"" face will I see ""C"" before this torture is over.

tt11214590,ur0366508,go,9 December 2021,"The lifestyles of the rich and famous make great fodder for cinema - beautiful people, scenic locations, wealth, power, scandal. HOUSE OF GUCCI certainly has all of that and more. Add in a generous budget, a bunch of famous actors and juicy real life story and it's a can't miss - right? Ridley Scott's movie certainly has its enjoyments, but, it lacks a consistent tone and focus.Based on the Guccis, an Italian family who became an international fashion institution, Becky Johnson and Roberto Bentivega's screenplay centers on Maurizio (Adam Driver) the son of co-founder Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons) and heir to half the Gucci brand. The other half is owned by a brother, Aldo (Al Pacino), who also has a son standing in line, Paulo (Jared Leto). Enter Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) who meets cute with Maurizio and entices him into marriage. The first half is set in the 70s and early 80s with disco music as a soundtrack and the beauty of Milan as a backdrop. It's a decently entertaining set-up. Once Rodolfo exits the scene, GUCCI takes a darker turn. The music and locations are still inviting, but, the characters become more and more bitter - at each other's throats (sometimes literally).The movie is devised as a big glossy soap opera. The backbiting, scheming and double-crosses keep it interesting enough, but, Scott never gets a firm handle on the material. The director has never shown a true light touch in his work (even if his THE MARTIAN was infamously put in the Best Comedy category by the not so Golden Globes). The heavily made-up Leto's Paulo is like a mad wind-up toy that has been over-wound and never lets up. Pacino is in full bluster mode trying to keep up (although, he does have a few quieter, better moments here and there). Jeremy Irons (who looks more and more like Boris Karloff every year) can't shake his British upper-lip countenance. Add in a dash of Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek to the stew of accents. Driver is simply miscast as a suave Mediterranean fashion mogul. He tries, but, it doesn't sell. And, poor Jack Huston (as Rodolfo's consigliere). He seems to think this is all a straight sober drama.Enter Lady Gaga. It's an out sized blowzy performance, worthy of a nighttime soap opera queen like Joan Collins in Dynasty (or Dallas, Knots Landing etc.). Gaga still isn't a polished actress, but, as the expression goes - she's gotta big personality. She's energetic and enthusiastic and carries much of the movie (Gaga wants that Oscar -- but is more likely to win a Golden Globe AND a Razzie). It's too bad the filmmakers didn't have the foresight to include a cat-fight between Patrizia and Maurizio's lady friend Paula (Camille Cottin)! Gaga's also one of the few in the main cast with an Italian background (nee Germanotta). Her accent may not feel utterly genuine but she carries it off (Pacino has long since sounded like any character other than ""Al Pacino"").If only Scott had channeled Gaga's cue and followed her lead throughout - make it a fun romp. Instead, the tenor of the picture seems to shift from scene to scene. The song score is confused as well - it begins with period appropriate specific tunes and then bounces back and forth, sometimes anachronistically (George Michael's 1987 'Faith' scores a 1972 wedding). Each actor is in their own movie. Some have called the movie ""camp"", but nothing in Scott's resume, interviews or public appearances indicate that the term would ever apply to him. Certainly, some of the humor is intended, but, any camp value is certainly unintentional. Further, the movie is simply too long and without a consistently strong narrative drive. It has it's moments, and Gaga is a soapy delight, but GUCCI lacks the one thing that the namesake family always prided itself on - a powerful dependable style.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur0366508/?ref_=tt_urv

It took me back to the films of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck who all would have killed each other to get a role as good as Patrizia Reggiani but I doubt they would have been equal to Lady Gaga's bravura portrayal of this gold digger from Milano who rises to world wide notoriety.Ga Ga didn't surprise me at all with her performance as I've admired her talent and originality for a long time but this is her finest 158 minutes on screen yet.She looks fabulous in costumes by Janty Yates reflecting Screen goddesses like Sophia Loren Gina Lollobrigida and Elizabeth Taylor who is referenced in the nightclub scene when Patrizia first meets Maurizio some enchanted evening across a crowded room .I've been won over recently by the performances of Adam Driver but never more so than his portrayal of Maurizio Gucci we see him transform from a charming Italian suitor besotted by the curvaceous and sensual Patrizia whose father employs him in his trucking business when he goes against his Pa Pa's wishes and marries the voluptuous Patrizia to later as the self assured and slightly ruthless Emperor of the Gucci fashion Empire who stabs the rest of the family in the back with the assistance of his ambitious wife.The chemistry on screen between GaGa and Driver is sensational I hope they team up again they are both a power house of acting talent .Do we have a new team like Tracey and Hepburn time will tell but both deserve Oscar consideration for this movie.Ridley Scott the 84 year old English director knows how to entertain movie audiences in any genre with films that range from Gladiator (2000) The Martian ,(2016) Thelma and Louise (1991) and another wealth tycoon movie All The Money in The World (2017) .I particularly liked The Last Duel which he directed last year also with Adam Driver he may not be the darling of the critics and although he has been nominated 4 times for an Oscar but never won the elusive statue he is in fine company with other great directors.I must read the book House of Gucci is based on by Sara Gay Forden as the Screen play writers Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna have managed to transfer it beautifully to the screen. They seem to have adopted a favourite axiom of mine that nothing succeeds like excess .This story while featuring a few non Italian actors like Jeremy Irons as the ailing father Rodolpho Gucci and Jared Leto who is unrecognisable as Paolo Gucci the dim witted cousin of Maurizio is as Italian as Parmesan cheese .Jared as Paolo imagines himself as the fashionista designer and at first seems to be channeling his inner Willy Wonka but it's an effective characterisation in my view.I read that some critics say Al Pacino is wasted in the role of Uncle Aldo Gucci father of Paolo but I think he gives a fine and passionate performance so valuable to the outcome of the story.It's a star studded cast that also included Salma Hayek as Patrizia's personal clairvoyant and Jack Huston as the Gucci legal minder Domenico De Sole , he's a cool customer who has some great scenes with Patrizia and Maurizio.The Gucci family in one explanation I read states that Sara Gay Forden's book cites a choice quote from Jenny Gucci, embittered ex-wife of Maurizio's cousin Paolo: ""What you have to understand about the Guccis,"" she sniped, ""is that they are all completely mad, incredibly manipulative, and not very clever.""
Pass the popcorn.What a great film to start 2022 off with a bang ignore some of the negative press .House of Gucci is a night at the Opera with gelato and fireworks a great soundtrack and some of the campiest lines in the dialogue I've seen in a movie in ages lines like Paulo proclaiming "" He wants to soar like a pigeon ""Patrizia's sign of the Cross to The Father ,Son and House of Gucci or her statement Patrizia Reggiani:
I don't consider myself to be a particularly ethical person, but I am fair.Aldo Gucci: Your son is smart lawyer. My son is an idiot. But he's my idiot.There are so many good lines and good performances in this movie

tt11214590,ur49208568,6,2 December 2021,"As I'm on holiday at the moment in Portugal, this was seen as ""Casa de Gucci"". But the soundtrack was English with Portuguese subtitles. At least, I *think* it was English!Positives:
Other than the bare outlines, it's a story I knew nothing about, so it made for interesting viewing. And who doesn't want to see some escapist high-fashion, flashy cars and Italian high-living on the big screen?Adam Driver delivers another stonking performance. He delivers the best of the accents on show and is a delight to watch whenever he's on screen. His performance is deliciously subtle and under-played. A model for acting lessons.Al Pacino, in full-on Pacino mode, is also great as Maurizio's uncle: owner of the other half of the empire.Negatives:
The accents! Where do I begin? I felt a desperate need mid-film to order a Cornetto and go compare my car insurance online. While Driver and Pacino tend to rein it in, most of the rest of the cast assume accents approaching a bad parody of Italians. Jared Leto and Gaga are particularly guilty.I appreciate that the part of the ""idiot"" Paolo Gucci was meant to be comedic, but Jared Leto seems to almost be in a different film entirely. There's 'over-the-top' and 'waaaaay over-the-top'.I've seen some other reviews praising Lady Gaga... saying that it proves her performance in ""A Star is Born"" wasn't just a ""flash in the pan"". Personally, I didn't feel it. I appreciate that the character of Patrizia is a larger-than-life one. But, although she did have some impressive scenes, for most of her performance I felt like she was obviously acting, and sometimes over-acting. The accent didn't help.The film has a banging set of tunes, no argument. But for a sprawling drama told over a few decades (the film is nearly 160 minutes long!), music should be used to anchor the movie as to which year you are currently in. Donna Summer ""I Feel Love"": so it must be 1977. But the movie doesn't consistently follow that rule. It's the early 70's, but suddenly George Michael's ""Faith"" blares out. #Unsettling.This may be my lack of concentration, but there seems to be an assertion in the film (presumably completely false) that Aldo Gucci was supporting/producing knockoff Gucci products for the mass-market: a ""lucrative product line"" that was later canned by Maurizio. I was personally confused by this bit of the story.Summary Thoughts on ""House of Gucci"": This was not the <2* bust that I thought it might be from early word I saw from other reviews. The fact that it turns out to be a 158 minute film surprised me, since it felt long... but not that long. So that's a good thing. And it has its moments for sure. But this is not a movie that I will be in a hurry to revisit, since the accents and some of the performances (Jared Leto - take one step forwards) are not ones that I thought worthy of the potential that the movie had. For me, Ridley, I'll take ""The Last Duel"" any day.(For the full graphical review, check out #onemannsmovies online. Thanks.)",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur49208568/?ref_=tt_urv

The performances fulfill their promise without standing out, except for Jared Leto who puts on a great performance. Salma Hayek, Jeremy Irons, and Al Pacino just put on good performances. The costume design is obviously focused on contemporary Gucci designs, making the story feel not even set in the '70s, '80s or '90s, decades in which the script is developed based on a true story. The greatest success of the film is the cinematography. The film was promoted as the one that would be the best of the year 2021 but it fails in the face of such an ambitious promotion.

tt11214590,ur147091341,7,18 December 2021,"So with Oscar season coming around the films that are expected to compete for the major awards are set to be released and House of Gucci has come out and I have watched it, so here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the rise of an ambitious woman as she infiltrates The Gucci family and organisation.Main Character
Lady Gaga has been gaining rave reviews for her performance as Madame Gucci and she is really good here. She plays this aggressive person really well and you see just how manipulative she can become in order to get what she wants. She does have a presence on the screen and there is no denying that your eyes are drawn to her during the film. I am not sure this is the groundbreaking performance that I was expecting but there is no denying that she does a really good job and considering she was just a singer a few years ago it is very impressive.Supporting Characters
In terms of acting the star for me was Adam Driver playing her husband. This guy has so much range as an actor that he can go from the bad guy in a Star Wars film to a kind of calm and measured powerful man in this film. Their dynamic is really good and I think both of them do a really great job of building the dynamic in the film. Jared Leto looks almost unrecognisable in the film but has some pretty good lines. He sometimes comes across as a caricature but he manages to balance it just well enough to be a fun part of the film. Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons play senior members of the Gucci family and they are obviously very good, Pacino in particular has a strong presence in the film and is an intriguing aspect of the overall story. Salma Hayek has a smaller role in the film and she also does a decent job though it is a slightly weird role that comes out of nowhere.Story
The story is really interesting in seeing the rise of the Gucci brand and all of the moving parts that take place in a massive company like this. All the actors play their role well and the family dynamic with real trust issues taking place between the characters. But this isn't the story I was really expecting, it feels like a long build up to the really interesting stuff which we never get to see. It focuses on so many broad subjects that it seems to struggle to focus on the more engaging parts of the plot.Script
The script is good, there is drama, intrigue and bits of humour there. It never becomes confusing when it really could of with all the business jargon But I felt like it never hit the top in terms of the dialogue, its good but its not great and for a film that I expected huge things from that is a let down.Style
The film looks fantastic, it feels really glamorise just like the lifestyle that these people and organisation had in real life. The choice of song and music really added to the feel of the film, and changed the dynamic compared to the scenery of the film. But the film is way too long, the runtime really holds the film back and I thought it could have done with a shorter runtime that really focused on the more interesting parts of the story.Overall
Overall, House of Gucci is a good film. It falls short from being a film of the year contender but if you are interested in this story of the rise of a fashion empire then go and watch it.Rating - 7/10.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur114450253,9,29 November 2021,"I found myself absolutely transfixed by House of Gucci. From the opening voiceover by Lady Gaga I was hooked and couldn't take my eyes off of the mad story that unfurled before me.As has been mentioned in numerous other reviews Lady Gaga's performance is a tour de force. Her portrayal of Patrizia Reggiani was incredible to watch and I would gladly watch this film again immediately purely to experience it for a second time. She was unstoppable in this film and everyone should see House of Gucci purely for her. It was a tough role with lots to the character and plenty to explore and dig through, and she managed it with great aplomb.As if that wasn't enough there's a terrifically entertaining (if slightly characitured and ludicrous) turn from Jared Leto who injected so much humour and light into the film. Adam Driver was brilliant, as was Al Pacino in a fantastic supporting role. All of them gelled so well together and I couldn't have asked for a better cast. The characters they played were so colourful and rich it was great exploring them and getting to know them.Telling the story of the rise and fall of various members of the Gucci family over a span of decades could have been quite lethargic and slow, but the story was well balanced and well handled. Perhaps a tad too long, 15 minutes could have been cut if I'm being honest, but that's such a small gripe. It was such a fascinating and outrageous story that I couldn't take my eyes off it and was always excited for what would be coming next.Much like the high fashion world it explored, this film oozed style and opulence. The sets, costumes, hair, makeup, all of them were spot on. It made the film feel so rich and refined.Really there isn't much to complain about with this film.

To be honest it was a nicely crafted inside the world of the rich and ""beautiful"". Very soap-operarish indeed but that was the whole point of it.The acting was good. I really liked Lady Gaga who gave everything with that role. She really embodied it, yes there was some overacting involved, but lets be honest, the real Patrizia is not really an introvert or quiet woman anyway, so that absolutely fits the role.A lot of people ignore Adam Driver but I want to point out that the indeed gives a great performance here. Its a very stiffy performance, especially next to Gaga, but also in this case, thats how Mauro Gucci was, so why would he play it differently? He was on the note.Al Pacino was good, as he did not take himself too seriously here (his last scene was amazing though). Jeremy Irons was also into it. To be very honest I was not a fan of Jared Leto. Yes I appreciate that he really changed (not only physically) for that role and approached a completely new acting style, but then he was just too cartoonish in my opinion.

tt11214590,ur18374284,7,13 January 2022,"""House Of Gucci"" is a crime drama film based on the non-fiction book ""The House Of Gucci: A Sensational Story Of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed"" by Sara Gay Forden. Directed by Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"") and starring Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Al Pacino, Jared Leto, and Jeremy Irons, it benefits mainly from the solid acting of two of its lead stars but falters at fully investing the audience in its story.In 1978 in Milan, Italy, Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) works for her father's trucking company that specialises in transporting concrete. One night at a party, Patrizia strikes up a conversation with Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), the heir apparent to 50% of his family's fashion label. Over time, Patrizia becomes determined to be involved in Maurizio's life, eventually causing him to fall in love with her. Despite warnings from his father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons), Maurizio decides to marry Patrizia and the latter settles in to her new life as an important but ultimately detrimental part of the Gucci family.When it comes to fashion labels and the companies behind them, I know practically next to nothing. All I am aware of is that they are multi-billion dollar enterprises that overcharge consumers for products that only the rich can afford. In spite of this, I do take a marginal interest in the history of how these types of companies can become huge in the first place and what may lead to their downfall. ""House Of Gucci"" shows how one woman helped lead a world famous family-owned business down a dark path, and while it mostly succeeds, it had so much potential to have done so better than it did.This film has the difficult task of making the life of a family whose name is synonymous with hedonism and materialism as interesting as possible. In that sense, it does manage to work, given that there are some eccentricities within the Gucci family worth elaborating on. I suppose this is similar to how some people might find the Kardashians amusing to watch. However, there is only focus placed around the lives of Patrizia and Maurizio while the rest of the Guccis are demoted to minor supporting roles. As a result, what we often get are long, repetitive scenes of Patrizia and Maurizio's marriage difficulties as well as ones with them flaunting their wealth and power. Granted, they do allow for some great moments of drama in the story, but there's only so much of this you can show before it becomes boring.I fully understand that it was because of Patrizia's influence that the Gucci brand went in the direction it did, but the whole time I was wishing the film had given equal attention to the other family members as well. It is established that all of the Guccis had a say in the fate of the family business so it was surprising to see the film barely touch on that. Given the film's length of 157 minutes, you'd expect a great deal of that time to be used on setting up the significance of Patrizia's presence within her newfound business venture. Rather, there are obvious moments of padding that drag the film on longer than it should, overstaying its welcome by at least half an hour.Ridley Scott, who had recently directed the medieval-themed ""The Last Duel"", helms this project with a similar scope to that of his 2017 film ""All The Money In The World"". Both films feature a wealthy family with a media event that shook their reputation to its core. Scott has always been a director renowned for his ability to insert the audience into an atmospheric location to show off the scale of how important it is that the characters are there in the first place. Here, Scott shows the far reach of the Gucci family's power by featuring a handful of the countries where they conduct their business, including Italy, France, the USA, and Switzerland. He does, however, have somewhat of a mixed reputation when it comes to directing dialogue scenes. As previously mentioned, some scenes do tend to drag at times due to some lengthy moments of exposition. I wouldn't have been too bothered by this if the exposition was interesting, but it's hard for me to be invested in conversations about selling designer handbags and clothes to the upper class.In addition to this, the film's inconsistent tone makes it hard to tell if it is trying to be a straight-up drama or a dark comedy. For example, there is a strange sex scene near the beginning that I guess is supposed to show the romantic passion between Patrizia and Maurizio. Instead of properly depicting the characters' love for one another, it just comes across as unintentionally funny and awkwardly placed in the story. If this was actually meant to be humorous, then it should not have immediately followed a serious scene where Maurizio is contemplating his future with either his birth family or his new one with Patrizia.Once upon a time, I would never have wanted to watch Lady Gaga in a movie, but ever since I saw ""A Star Is Born"" back in 2018, my opinion of her completely changed. Gaga has proven herself to be a highly talented actress, with the ability to carry the correct amount of emotional weight required in films like this. Since Gaga is of Italian heritage, she has no trouble playing a character like Patrizia Reggiani without descending into a stereotypical caricature. She is easily the best part of the movie, portraying Patrizia as a Shakespearean opportunist seizing her moment for wealth and power the moment it arises.Likewise, Adam Driver is appropriately reserved as Maurizio Gucci, the man next in line to inherit his father's fashion empire. Driver has always had this knack for playing someone who could be considered the straight man of the film but would easily break his composure to become a force to be reckoned with if he ever needed to. I liked his chemistry with Gaga, as the two made for a convincing couple. Driver had previously worked with Ridley Scott in ""The Last Duel"" so it seems like he may end up becoming a recurring collaborator with the director.Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the rest of the cast felt like they went to waste. Jeremy Irons was only in about two scenes before we never see him again, which is a shame because I would have liked for there to have been more moments with him and Adam Driver, his onscreen son. The legendary Al Pacino's talents are easily forgotten since he spends a large amount of the movie in a different country, and whenever we do see him he has little effect the rest of the story. But perhaps the biggest waste of an actor was the almost unrecognisable Jared Leto as Paulo Gucci, Maurizio's cousin. Leto had the potential to steal the movie, since it's so difficult to tell it is him at first, both visually and audibly, but just like Irons and Pacino, he doesn't stick around long enough to do anything noteworthy.For what it is, ""House Of Gucci"" is still an enjoyable look into the life of a famous fashion-oriented family that turned their name into the empire it is today. Though it doesn't humanise them the way I had hoped, it nonetheless paints them in vulnerable light I would not have expected to see in this type of movie. Despite the negative connotations the name ""Gucci"" carries even to this day, it's somewhat admirable to see that they were able to endure on regardless of that stigma. As long as there are people out there willing to fork out thousands of dollars for overpriced merchandise, their name will continue to live on. And if their name lives on, then there will certainly be films made to help immortalise that legacy.I rate it 6.5/10.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur132809519,6,2 February 2022,"House of Gucci unfortunately alines with the track that chooses style over substance. Ridley Scott's only slightly watchable crime-drama with some really great stars fails to steer clear from being firmly pinned to the ground by its poor presentation of the featured subject matter, overall making it a missed opportunity with wasted potential.There's no doubt that this movie was trying to create an excellent visual style to place aside its story. The visual aspect of House of Gucci is utterly glamorous, full of fashion and perfectly fits with its time setting and story. However, it kind of seems like it would either choose to be more visually appealing than plot-gripping or they tried to perfection the cinematography and the actual story ends up being pretty bland.It's not purposefully great at correctly capturing the events, but the prolonged runtime targets what feel like uneventful and boring situations. Although it's commonly slow, it's at least watchable enough to be able to sit through the entire thing. And the cast, usually consisting of Lady Gaga, Adam Driver and Al Pacino are memorable in their roles.

tt11214590,ur81864032,7,30 November 2021,"While the Gucci fashion brand has left an everlasting legacy for decades, many people don't know much about its controversial history. Although author Sara Gay Forden made a detailed biographical book on the Gucci dynasty in 2000, acclaimed filmmaker Ridley Scott has presented a film inspired by the events this year, with an ensemble cast such as Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Jared Leto, Jeremy Irons, Al Pacino & Salma Hayek. Despite obtaining a mixed reception from critics and not performing too well at the box office, it has been getting a good amount of attention from the media for its portrayal of the famed Gucci married couple corrupting each other for the sake of the company.Set in Italy, the film follows a young middle class working woman named Patrizia Reggiani, who ends up pursuing Maurizio Gucci, a shy privileged man who hails from the famed Gucci family. Upon marrying one another, their initial affectionate romance transitions into a ruthless fight for control of the Gucci brand. Similar to Forden's aforementioned book, the film recaps numerous events that led to the broken relationship of Patrizia and Maurizio, such as the class distinctions between their families, constant pushing to aim higher, Maurizio's own family members getting in the way, and even illegal financial turmoil. While it doesn't go into every detail about the Gucci's lives, it does highlight how overly persistent Patrizia is in taking over the lives of her husband, let alone an entire empire. Even if Patrizia does love Maurizio, it's only in lieu of her own selfish drive to push the Gucci brand further to suit her own ego. As quick as the pacing of the plot can be, it justly summarizes how one woman led her own in-laws down a path of deceit and corruption. Destruction of marriage is one thing, but destruction of human behavior can bring out the worst in a clan of people.That being said, the actors are what people will remember this movie for more, and the filmmakers definitely delivered on that front. Lady Gaga and Adam Driver steal the show in presenting the contrasting personalities between the seductive manipulator Patrizia and the anxiously minded Maurizio, mainly through specific facial expressions and aggressive actions over their otherwise exaggerated accents. Al Pacino shows so much love and passion as Maurizio's uncle Aldo, but can also flip to furious and overly hurt when confronting the differences in his New York lifestyle and how law is handled in Italy. Meanwhile, Jared Leto borders on caricature playing Aldo's oddball fool of a son Paolo, but the pressure from his family's standards and Patrizia's conniving nature allows for a ripe amount of sympathy in the otherwise weird man. Alongside Jeremy Irons, Salma Hayek, Jack Huston and Camille Cottin contributing a lot to the story with fewer scenes, the film allows a lot of logic to seep from the supporting cast to bounce off of the insane madness caused by Patrizia's malicious drive towards the Gucci brand. Sounds like the Oscars have some homework to do in terms of the cast.In terms of other qualities, it's impressive how quickly the film was shot and edited during the pandemic, in under a year. With that in mind, the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski paints an authentic view of Italy from the late 70s to the mid 90s just as much as the flawless production design. The filmmakers made excellent use of the time period by showing how grandiose the Gucci life is, especially from the perspective of the middle class Reggiani clan. Whenever the film showcases the Gucci brand work itself, one has to wonder how much effort it took for the people behind the film to secure any rights in displaying the immersively beautiful attire. The costume design also adds in to the film's believability, as the men tend to wear conservative outfits common for upper class business folk whereas the women have a more tight and unveiling wardrobe. The film gets a lot of creative mileage when the work of former Gucci fashion designer Tom Ford gets a spotlight in the third act, even if the hard work from the Gucci family has been left to the wayside. Perhaps many of the film's artistic choices are a result of style over substance, but at least the style adds into the narrative poignantly.So while it may juggle its tone between inspired camp and mournful drama, House of Gucci is an enjoyably interesting look into the events of the Gucci brand family downfall with a lovable cast, gorgeous set and costume design and important historical context. If you're interested in seeing the film, bet it for a historical perspective or for the cast alone, it's a solid enough recommendation, unless you'd rather stick to Sara Gay Forden's aforementioned biography. Even for a two and a half hour long venture, it doesn't feel the length as much as other overly long features these days. As far as infamous career scandals go, this feature has one heck of a downfall.",6,12,/user/ur81864032/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur63857399,6,27 November 2021,"I always have to start with the positive, that's always been my mantra even when trying to verbalize after seeing something horrendous. The tonal inconsistency in House of Gucci is insane but the movie does have a lot of polish. I must give credit to Dariusz Wolski (who regularly works with Ridley Scott) for the work he did filming this environment. The cinematography feels very cold and distant from all the high drama going on with the characters. The sets and atmosphere are pretty but instead of going with a hyper-stylized angle, Scott and his team went the other direction and it was an interesting contrast. More importantly, I cannot stress enough how much Lady Gaga's performance as Patrizia is dragging this movie up the mountain. Her back's got to be sore from carrying this movie. Despite the iffy dialogue, the weird character dynamics, the rest of the cast being all over the map and the strangely muted plot, I was entranced by her committed work in this. Despite the rest of the movie being a gong show, she does deserve award consideration for her portrayal in this and I applaud her going the extra mile. I also would add that while I was mostly flummoxed by this movie, it wasn't boring and while I got more than a few unintentional laughs, House of Gucci kept my attention and that should count for something.Going into House of Gucci, I was expecting Patrizia to be painted as a ruthless, and power-hungry tactician who saw Maurizio as nothing but her ticket to the good life. This isn't completely different from what we got but that kind of description is too simplistic for her character. By the end of House of Gucci, I didn't despise her like I expected to but that was more the result of the movie not presenting anyone to care about. She's still manipulative, nasty and arrogant but everyone else is so self-absorbed too. Maurizio is a sap who shows little emotion at first (to the point where the beginning of movie is extremely cringe-worthy) and he inexplicably buys into his own hype at the end of the movie when he's done very little to achieve what he has. Aldo is coasting of previous success, he overestimates his importance to the company and he is completely two-faced. Rodolfo is stuck in his ways and needlessly prejudicial and Paolo is a moron and lacks any awareness of the consequences of his actions. By the end of the movie, there are no sympathetic characters and despite the crescendo in the final scenes, I felt very little for any of them.I also expected some shady back-room deals being crafted, some tense power struggles between family and some insight into how Gucci became a high-fashion empire. You get none of that in House of Gucci. Any subplot involving how Gucci made its fortune or achieved business success is picked up and immediately dropped. The characters scream and holler but then are crying and professing love in the next moment and to some extent, they're all acting like a buffoons. The corruption isn't hidden or surprising with how the creative team chooses to present it and the excess of the Gucci family is treated with a collective shrug. Sure they're spending millions of dollars on toys when they don't have the money.....but they deserve that because their last names are Gucci? It was surprising how little depth there is to the plot and while I understand the decision to focus on the characters, I wanted more from the story.Let's move past Lady Gaga doing stellar work in the lead role, this is a packed cast but it seemed like everyone showed up with their own ideas of what to do with the material and there was no moderator to establish a consistent tone. Adam Driver is normally great but combine his bland character with him just being so muted, I couldn't care about Maurizio's problems. Put Jeremy Irons in the underacting camp as well, like Driver, his character seems to be drawn that way. He can't circumvent that however and he doesn't leave much of an impression as Rodolfo. On the other side of the spectrum, God bless Jared Leto for trying his best. I'm worried that this will be another Razzie nomination for him. His performance is akin to his Joker portrayal in Suicide Squad. To be fair, he's got serious acting talent and he's fully committed to the role. But he's so out of touch with the rest of the movie and I think he's supposed to be the comedic relief? His choices and the dialogue he's given are so outlandish that I didn't laugh or snicker, I just sat there is awe of how out of sync he was. Pacino is over-the-top too, just not to Leto's extent. I'm used to him being the tough guy and this character represented a curveball. Salma Hayek was fine, I had more questions about her character than comments on her performance.Its a small not but I also couldn't help but notice how off key the score is with the tone of the movie. The tone isn't consistent at all but the music in House of Gucci varies from opera to classical to contemporary pop and how they picked where each song was going to be inserted into the movie is a complete dice role. There's very little flow from scene to scene through the score. This carries over into the editing too, the movie feels really choppy. We'll get emotional scenes that smash cut to a board room negotiation for example and it just throws the narrative that much more out of whack.How in on the joke was the creative team for House of Gucci? That probably seems like a mean question but between the insane tonal shifts, the over and under acting, the messy score and editing and the bizarrely shallow plot, were they setting this up to be a campy masterpiece? This is a great so-bad-its-good movie for me. If I were to purely rate it on quality, its a 3 or a 4 but with Gaga's performance and the sheer insanity of the rest of the movie, I'll bump it up to a 6. The most similar movie I can think of is London Fields but even that's not an apples to apples comparison. I can't recommend seeing House of Gucci in theatres but if you're into this type of movie (ludicrous but entertaining), its absolutely worth streaming when it comes out on your preferred platform.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tt_urv

Instead, he is neck deep in it. Sir, the Scott name means something as well.This mediocre effort to bring light to the crumbling house of a brand that the world is familiar with exists in people who focus on labels. And in this case Lady Gaga (and brand herself) plays the outsider marrying into the family name expecting one thing and getting another.The way Gaga portrays Patrizia Reggianni isn't of a gold digger which is clear that the living patriarch Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons) sees her as. Instead, she is swept up into the myth of the name (which is never really illustrated here). Patrizia came from a upper middle class family. But, in this world image is everything.Enter, Maurizio Gucci. A sweet boy who is studying to be a lawyer. He is awkward and is, what Michael Corleone was before the business got to him. The similarity is obvious. He gets pulled into that superficial world against some of his skepticism about his unearned wealth. A good guy who found the wrong woman.In fact, Patrizia's family takes him in, after he is cut from the family by Rodolfo.Very little time passes before he is re-inserted into their lives. And if watching the dynamics of a family feud over wealth is fascinating to you...this is the movie.There is a moment when Patrizia concludes that the name meant a lot to her. When she discovers a knock-off brand of the item. The other half of Gucci, run by Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino) happens to like that there are imitators. It meant a form of success. A lesson that will be learned later on, as the fortune bounces around.A lot has been said about Jared Leto's Paolo Gucci. My God, his performance is best described as Italian minstrel. If you are Italian and aren't insulted, I'd be surprised.The movie ends abruptly. As if they just wanted the movie to end. There is no real sense of emotion from the outcome. You don't really root for any of them. They're all somewhat despicable in their own way. But there is something interesting about how when you run a family business, sometimes you get wrapped up into the spectacle and history and forget it's still a business.Overall, it's a very mediocre film from Sir Scott. Though I have to say, kudos for having TWO films out in the same year.

In other words, they gave us ZERO reasons why Patricia and Maurizio fell in love and quickly married.

The inability to capture the time and place in a coherent way. One minute it felt 80s, the next 70s, the next 90s.

Even someone like me who does not have prior knowledge of the incident is worried about Gucci family's reaction to 'House of Gucci'. However, the script itself works more than fine. Its progress of Maurizio becoming more like Patrizia and other Guccis is so interesting to watch, and Driver's performance is immaculate to engage audience in his storytelling.If the movie divided a victim and a murderer or good and evil from the start - and lasted whole 150 mins that way - it would have been a failed screenwriting. All of us know the villain of the story, and the fact Patrizia arranged murder and married for Maurizio's last name does not change. However, Maurizio's not all good, which may be more realistic way to approach him. At first, he does not want anything to do with Gucci and has the happiest of his time in truck company. He rather hesitates on accepting any work offer by his uncle. It is Patrizia who makes him responsible, ambitious, expensive, and businessman-like. When he finally turns to be the man she wants, he does not need her anymore. His ambition exceeds hers, tossing her away. He is a coward till the end. He hides behind Investcorp to take share of his uncle and his cousin and behind his lawyer to divorce his wife. He runs away from cops on his motorcycle, leaving his daughter behind and is physically unable to confront his uncle, hiding behind the door.

Gucci in the 60s was already a big empire and as an outsider that never really cared about fashion, I am not really sure what was the point of this motion picture. The film shows how Maurizio took over the company with his unethical methods, but aside from ruining completely the relationship with his own family members, it seems that he did not accomplish anything. He improved nothing in the business and took the enterprise to the verge of bankruptcy, so he did more harm than good. Patrizia Reggiani was for the whole time so manipulative, and I hated her character for the whole time. She was in fact after the Gucci money. Maurizio should have listened to his father. The beginning of their relationship is portrayed in such a childish and immature way. I refuse to believe that this is what really happened between the two. At this point I would have preferred to watch a film about Aldo Gucci, and how he managed to transform a small business into such a big and rich company. It would have been way more interesting and at least I would have walked out of the theatre with a little bit more knowledge.A lot of scenes feel odd, empty and pointless. Lady Gaga is stunning and gave a decent performance, but they could have hired someone more competent. She is an excellent singer, but please, keep her away from acting. I really enjoyed Adam Driver and Al Pacino. Jared Leto's acting was different and quite funny, he was a pleasant surprise, and he added a lot of value to the film. From a technical perspective, the photography was smooth and simple and perfectly matched the mood of the film.I have to be honest: I had quite big expectations for this one, but I was extremely disappointed. I went to see this movie mainly because of the director and the cast. I know nothing about fashion or Gucci, maybe I am not in the target area, but still I think that they could have done so much more with a big brand such as this one. The plot has its good moments and it is entertaining enough to keep me until the end, even though I would have cut a couple of scenes. It is not a bad production, but I think that this was an unnecessary and uninspired movie. I would recommend waiting for the release of ""House of Gucci"" on some streaming service or on Blu-ray.

In other words, the film is sharply tuned enough to have its proverbial cake and eat it too.Set over a 20-year period, the film takes us through the many shifts in power in the Gucci family who ran an iconic fashion brand, back when being rich meant living the kind of visibly flamboyant life that would get you on page 6.Adam Driver as Maurizio is initially framed as the protagonist. He carries himself with suave in a way that someone can only pull off if they're born into class. Still, he's quiet and unassuming and just the right kind of stooge to have his world turned upside down when middle class opportunist Patrizia (Lady Gaga in a breakout performance) aggressively steals his heart similar to some of the screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s when a matinee idol came face to face with a floozy like Barbara Stanwyck who could talk a fast game.As Maurizio and Patrizia get settled, Patrizia begins to Lady MacBeth her way through the relatives (Jeremy Irons, Jared Leto, Al Pacino) that stand between Patrizia and a greater share of wealth and power. And so begins a series of events that's darkly comic in a Coenesque way while giving the kinds of thrills from showing the financially mighty fall that makes shows like HBO's ""Succession"" such a huge hit.Considering she doesn't sing or don costumes made of meat, Lady Gaga immerses herself into this performance so well, it will have viewers doing a double take. Similarly, Adam Driver might have his best performance to date, Selma Hayek is a riot, and the cast's two elder statesman--Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons--command tremendous presence.Audience reactions might differ, but i found the film highly thoughtful and engaging through a plus-sized running time.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur0204528/?ref_=tt_urv

Character development is good and there is a clear image portrayed of each, providing the audience with an impression which is able to evolve over the years. Having said that, Hayek's inclusion, although potentially vital for the finale, seems a little shoehorned in, as the fortune teller from the TV is suddenly right in the middle of the main character's life, with little explanation.Ultimately, it is a very stylish crime drama which appears to take half of it's inspiration from Macbeth and the other from The Godfather, without really going close to having the impact of either.",1,1,/user/ur123203865/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur131685693,6,13 December 2021,"I came to the film with literally no knowledge of Gucci outside of Kreayshawn's opinions on the brand. The film unfolds in typical biopic fashion, focusing on the love story that spurs the ""rise to the top"" before heading towards the inevitable ""mo money, mo problems"" decline. Early portions of the film had me wondering if there really was a story worth telling in all of this, as the operations of a big fashion company do little to hold my interest, and some light family and relationship drama don't go a long way to justify such a lavish Hollywood production. When the film eventually reaches it's dramatic climax, the intrigue of the story does finally click, but I can't help but wonder if things were somewhat weighted towards the wrong elements.Patrizia Reggiani truly is a fascinating person, and Lady Gaga is shockingly good at capturing the nuance of the character. However many of the elements of her story seemed to be glossed over quickly. From the dissolution of her marriage to the aftermath of her revenge, the film moved really quickly through the most interesting parts. At nearly 3 hours long, it's not lacking in details, but watching old men manage their millions is nowhere near as compelling as seeing a women being driven to her breaking point.Still, it's obviously a well made film, one does not simply get Ridley Scott clout for being a hack. It is questionable however to have an all American cast speaking exclusively in Italian accents. Not having the background myself, it's tricky to judge who's nailing it and who's not, but it's just weird to have it in your head the whole time that everyone is faking their dialect. Mind you, it doesn't take a real Italian to see through Jared Leto's laughably over the top performance. The makeup work may be an impressive achievement, but he's an embarrassing caricature of Italian stereotypes who seemed to research his role by playing Mario Cart, and was a complete mismatch for the real life person he is trying to convey.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur131685693/?ref_=tt_urv

For me, what I love about his films was they had a meticulous, professional, methodical way of being told. The tiny thing I didn't like about them, was that the attention to detail, added to the length of his films, would lead to a slightly slower pace, that made the action, suspense and thrills come to a crawl. This would create an up and down pace throughout the whole film. It's like being in your car and you continue to hit the gas, then the brakes, then the gas again, then the brakes. It is a minor thing and never effected the quality of the final film, but I do think it is there sometimes in his films. This film offered me an interesting opportunity to see something Ridley Scott directed, that wasn't a science fiction, horror or action film. House of Gucci (2021), is purely a biopic, drama, with romance, comedy and little crime thrown in. It offered the cool chance to see, if that pacing problem would occur, if it was a film that didn't have a lot of action, suspense and chills.Adam Driver plays Maurizio Gucci, one of the future heirs to the Gucci empire. His father, Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons), is an ageing, dying, ex-movie star from Hollywood's golden age. His uncle is Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino), who is the man responsible for all those famous Gucci designer handbags and accessories. This biopic covers the lives of the Guccis from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. In the late 70s Maurizio meets a woman, from a respectable home-life, named Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga). They fall in love, get married, get pregnant and then she begins to interject herself more and more into the Gucci legacy. Without giving too much away (although you can probably look this all up in the history books), aging fathers/uncles, lawsuits, power hungry people, money grubbing relatives, tax shenanigans and a handful of other misdeeds, lead to the answers as to why the Gucci empire doesn't have a single Gucci working for them today.Ridley Scott directs this film well, but it is the performances by the excellent cast, that is the highlight of this film. The film moves at a nice pace and the story flows well. There are plenty of comedic splashes seen in the film too. I'm sure some Hollywood sensationalism was used in this film, but then again, it's based off of a novel with ""A Sensational Story"" in its subtitle, so that doesn't really effect the overall film for me. I'm not really looking for historical accuracies in a movie. I can look that up myself. Other than a few blemishes I saw in its design, this film ended up being an interesting and enjoyable time at the movies.7.5 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur109135693/?ref_=tt_urv

Director: Ridley Scott
Starring: Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Jared Leto, Salma Hayek, Jack Huston etcWhen Patrizia Reggiani, an outsider from humble beginnings, marries into the Gucci family, her unbridled ambition begins to unravel their legacy and triggers a reckless spiral of betrayal, decadence, revenge, and ultimately murder. I was really disappointed with House of Gucci, it had a strong first half but a terrible second half.My first few positives would be the fantastic cinematography and set locations. As well as the great performances and chemistry between the cast. And the amazing costume design. This film was visually stunning, the lighting and the use of colour in particular made the film come to life, also helped with beautiful set locations, showcasing the elegance and wealth associated with the Gucci brand. I also thought the performances here were very strong. Al Pacino and Adam Driver delivered strong and complex performances and they stole every scene that they were in. But the star of the show here was Lady Gaga. She was absolutely fantastic, she embodied Patrizia and bought her to life incredibly well. She was charming, intimidating and delivered and emotionally complex performance that is awards worthy. And the romantic chemistry between Gaga and Adam Driver was electric and amazing to watch. The costume design was also amazing. It was elegant, chic and stunning to look at and delivered on what Gucci is known for. Lady Gaga had some excellent costumes that showcased her characters rise to power and wealth very well.My next few positives would be the character conflict and development. As well as the great campy tone and humour. And finally the great soundtrack, fantastic script and interesting themes. I thought the character conflict and development for Patrizia was fantastic. As her influence and power increased, so did the tension between the Gucci family as the weak were separated from the pack and Patrizia bought something fresh and new to the table, and the character conflict this caused was excellent to watch. I also loved the campy tone and humour this film had. For the most part it didn't take itself too seriously with the over the top extravagance expected with a movie about a large fashion company. Ridley managed to balance this campiness with the serious elements well. I also thought the soundtrack was excellent, it bought so much to the scenes and fitted the tone excellently. Finally, I thought the themes and the script were very strong. The dialogue was sharp and witty and touched on some important issues when it comes to women in positions of power. And the negative impact of wealth and greed.However, this film was a massive disappointment and had a lot of flaws. The pacing and structure was all over the place. The film often played it safe, with a terrible performance from Jared Leto. And had poor creative decisions and a bland second half. This film had some of the messiest pacing I have seen. Ranging from completely rushing over countless plot points never allowing anything to develop or connect. And frantically moving from plot point to plot point, with a structure that was all over the place. There was no clear time period and often scenes felt out of place or strangely positioned within the structure. I found that the film played it safe with a lot of the conflict and campiness. It could have been so much bigger and punchier, and despite brief moments, ultimately didn't live up to what it could have been. I also thought the performance from Jared Leto was terrible. It was over the top and laughable. There is a difference between method acting and looking like you are in a completely different movie to everyone else. I also thought the creative decision to practically remove Lady Gaga from the movie in the second half was poor, it took away from what made the movie work so much. And instead turned into a bland and tedious family drama and lost everything that made it start off strong.Overall, House of Gucci is fun and stylish. And the fantastic performances make the film completely watchable with an Oscar worthy performance from Lady Gaga. But its pacing and structure is such a big problem. With a second half that completely loses the style, campiness and everything that made the movie work. This was such a big disappointment from Ridley Scott.Overall rating 56/100.",1,3,/user/ur101128147/?ref_=tt_urv

tt11214590,ur34790048,5,28 November 2021,"House of Gucci is a new crime drama directed by Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator and Alien.The film is inspired by true events surrounding the family behind the Italian fashion house Gucci. When Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) begins a relationship with the outsider Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), he is disinherited by his father Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons). He suspects that Patrizia is behind Maurizio's family money. That's how the two have to make it without the support of the Gucci family. Years later, the two are married and have a child together. Maurizio's uncle Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino) thus contacts him again and brings him back into the family business. The Gucci fashion house is once again going under multiple names, leading to creative differences, exposing betrayal, revenge and even murder cases.There have been many changes in the making of this film. Martin Scorsese, for example, could have directed the film at first, but Ridley Scott was eventually given a directing position. Together with the casting directors, he also had many ideas for the casting of the roles before they finally came to the chosen actors and actresses.After the many changes in casting and direction, they probably should have looked back at the writing crew of the film, because the final script was written by more novice writers, which can sometimes be seen in the film. The story can sometimes seem a bit messy and so long-winded, because the story makes many jumps in time. Some relationships come across as rushed, which can cause some loss of credibility.What comes out best in the film about a well-known fashion brand is therefore the costumes and make-up of the characters. Janty Yates can expect film award nominations for this. Still, the film has received complaints from actual members of the Gucci family that the relatives were better dressed in real life compared to the actors in the film. They also credibly convey the places where the story takes place.Al Pacino comes out the best of the film cast and knows how to provide the best and most believable accent compared to the entire cast. Lady Gaga and Adam Driver have good chemistry together in the film, but their relationship sometimes comes across as weak. Patrizia is clearly showing signs that she is more behind the Gucci family's money than she really loves Maurizio. Their accents can also come across as a bit unusual. Lady Gaga has more of an Eastern European accent than real Italian. Her characters seem to come more from Russia in some scenes. Of the entire cast, Salma Hayek is the only one who has received help with speaking in the correct accent. This is probably because she is married to the man who now owns the Gucci brand. If they had helped the entire cast a little more with their accents in the film, they would have come across a bit more like people from the same country. Who even seems to play in a completely different film is Jared Leto, because in the film he wears a fattening costume and also has a strange shaved hair style. In the film, he comes across as too exaggerated compared to the rest and speaks excessively in a high-pitched voice. He sometimes sounds just like the video game character Mario.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur34790048/?ref_=tt_urv

One of the giants of the fashion industry the institution has always been associated with class, prestige and quality. And like most affluent businesses run by families the Guccis are associated with tragedy. ""The House of Gucci"" depicts the drama of the family during a difficult period in their storied history. Business, sex, romance, passion, infidelity, conflict, wealth and family revolve on a stage leading to murder. Led by an all-star cast including Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Al Pacino, Jared Leto, Jeremy Irons and Salma Hayek the film is a well-acted portrayal ably directed by Ridley Scott. The only flaw of the movie is its length where the simple and mundane tale is stretched beyond its purpose weighing it with inevitable tedium. Lady Gaga's harsh, unpleasant face and diminutive features don't help. The film would have worked best with a shorter and more concise 75-90 minutes.

tt11214590,ur33659536,8,28 November 2021,"""House of Gucci"" is an exercise in over-exaggeration - from the soundtrack, to the accents, to the performances, the only word that can be accurately used to describe this movie is ""ridiculous."" That said, this ridiculousness makes for one incredibly entertaining movie experience.I almost didn't go see this in theatres because I was somewhat taken aback by the 2 hour and 37 minute runtime. However, I begrudgingly dragged myself to the movies, and I'm so happy that I did. ""House of Gucci"" is self-indulgence at its best; if you ever wanted to see a story of vain, rich, and powerful people who want nothing more than to further grow their power and wealth, then this has you covered. Everything, from the performances to the way the movie is edited, feels amplified by the fact that the movie is portraying a group of narcissists, and I think Ridley Scott took this into consideration with his choice of direction. It would've been so easy to take this film, with its admittedly dark subject matter, and turn it into a depressing, dreary drama. Scott instead injects this film with telenovela level ludicrousness, and the movie is all the better for it.It's hard to say that anyone in this movie is good - that said, I can't exactly say that anyone was necessarily bad because of how much they entertained me. Everyone is certainly playing a character in this movie, and that character's name is ""Narcissus."" From Lady Gaga's raw hunger for money and status to Jared Leto's strong desire to be recognized for his ""gift"" in fashion designing, practically every actor and actress in this movie is playing someone who wants more; because of that, everyone over-exaggerates. And I loved it. The Italian accents? Bizarre. The dialogue? Pretentious. The performances? Totally scene-chewing (don't even get me started on Jared Leto's performance - completely bizarre, but extremely fun). But all of it worked strictly because this movie is depicting people who are completely separated from reality because of the fact that they have money and power.I feel like I've been repeating myself for three paragraphs, so now I'd like to simply answer this question: Is ""House of Gucci"" a good film? To be completely honest with you, I'm not so sure it is. As a whole, this movie is less of a coherent story and more of a collection of vignettes. The plot feels very jumbled, with the film moving from scene to scene with little narrative cohesion. Sure, we know the story involves Patrizia Reggiani ordering the killing of Maurizio Gucci, but that is barely explored in this movie. The consequences of that act? How Patrizia and crew were caught and convicted of such a crime? The effects that crime had on Patrizia and her children? These aspects are not touched on at all. Instead, the movie tells many individual stories about each character, and the Gucci brand. It wasn't the narrative choice I was expecting, but I didn't necessarily dislike this decision, as the ins and outs of the fashion business, and all of the backstabbing therein, made for some riveting viewing.Look, this isn't a great movie by any means - anyone can watch this and realize that it feels like a parody of the fashion business and the people that work in it, but I think that's all on purpose. Ridley Scott forgoes seriousness and embraces farce, and in ""House of Gucci,"" it works. I had an absolute blast watching this, and when rated on entertainment value alone, ""House of Gucci"" definitely is worth the theatre experience.",18,29,/user/ur33659536/?ref_=tt_urv

tt11214590,ur6732597,8,11 December 2021,"I initially found the trailer previews to paint Lady Gaga in a bad light, as her accent seemed more Russian than Italian. However, in the film Lady Gaga performs her role superbly. However, Adam Driver seems very much checked out in his performance. When he is on-screen, he is not eye-grabbing. I found myself wishing for the scene to end quickly so another character could be seen.Easily the best performance, and a little shout out to costume and make-up to help, is from Jared Leto. I did not recognize him at all. He didn't look like the same guy from Requiem for a Dream, Fight Club, or Suicide Squad. I didn't notice his voice as his Italian accent and his character were so well-done I completely didn't see the actor. All I saw was Paolo Gucci. He was surreal. He easily outshined everyone, including Gaga.I do feel like the previews gave a different impression, however. I went into the film thinking Patrizia was a diabolical manhunter who seized control of Gucci and warded off the family. I was wrong, and although Patrizia seduces Maurizio to take control of Gucci her plan never truly succeeds and I feel that Maurizio is the true villain of the film, albeit for a short time frame.Lady Gaga's performance is on level with what she accomplished in A Star Is Born with Bradley Cooper. She is becoming a household name in film as much as she has with music. The story is interesting enough to keep you focused and intrigued to find out which Gucci member will come out ahead. Its runtime of over two and a half hours is a bit much, but it never drags on. Thankfully, we don't have to sit through boring court trials, depositions, and the like and instead are treated to final overlaying text exposition to finish off the film for revealing what has happened with Gucci up till now.It's not the best film to come out this year, but it's pretty close to being so.

Jeremy Irons always terrific but his accent faded in and out. Pacino at his best. Jared Leto was directed to play his part as an operatic caricature buffoon and did so impressively. Photography stunning and operatically themed music perfectly arranged.My only minor criticism is that Scott got a bit too much into his own operatic allegory with characteristic overplaying of dramatic scene endings. Some of the cinematic allegories also went on a bit longer and were less subtle than I personally would have preferred. Again, very minor. House of Gucci is a lot of fun with Oscar-nomination-worthy performances from its two leads and possibly Leto.

tt11214590,ur24884343,8,4 December 2021,"House of Gucci (2021)For a film with Gucci in it's title, I was slightly worried that it will turn out to be a story focused primarily on fashion but seeing Ridley Scott as the director, I confidently marched into the cinema expecting something special. I don't know how much exactly was based on a true story but the final product was anything but a fashion story. On the contrary, this film is a tale of intrigue, betrayal and an endless chase for power which surrounded the pivotal years of one of the biggest fashion brands in the world.A story about a family squabble would be nothing without a strong cast and this collection of actors does a neat trick of allowing you to feel a range of negative emotions towards every single one of them. The story begins with Lady Gaga trying to slither into the family by bewitching a naive heir to the empire. Unknowingly, through her bullish and vulgar nature, she sparks a number of individuals to create tremors that will shake the very foundation of this house. While Gaga is a definite standout, Jared Leto comes in second best as he embodies his idiotic character in a humorously natural manner creating havoc everywhere he looks.The story's awkward beginning made me feel like I was watching an episode of The Office but then, the film got into the groove and started serving up twists and turns while saturating everything in Gucci luxury. Even though some characters' accents actually felt on point in creating the right mood, others really struggled and as a result, some moments felt like a parody which could be the only knock on this movie. Costumes, music and the cinematography worked towards the common objective of establishing a sense of style which was enjoyably over the top. By the end of the film, I wasn't sure how much of it was fictional but I was satisfied with this entertaining version of the truth.P. S.

Sadly what we ended up with in the end is anything but. It feels like a pale imitation of Wolf of Wall Street with sequences that really invoke the Scorsese film, the thing is that while Wolf of Wall Street is 3 hours long and phenomenally paced, this film is anything but.

Examples of this include the discussion around inheritance tax after Jeremy Iron's death and Adam Driver fleeing to Switzerland after the police start raiding his home
4) The trailers and the opening sequence of the film both give away that Adam Driver is going to be assassinated.

Director Ridley Scott can certainly consider ""House Of Gucci"" one of his filmmaking masterpieces.Screenplay by Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna, with the story based on Becky Johnston work, enhanced this film like a fine print on one of Gucci's signature scarves. Sara Gay Forden's book found ideal adaptation in MGM's ""House Of Gucci"" on Amazon Prime VOD.Harry Gregson-Williams' musical scoring was aces. The soundtracks - especially a popular title given an Italian covers, like Caterina Caselli's ""I'm A Believer"" - was great. Dariusz Wolski brought a powerful element to cinematography. Devious editing by Claire Simpson. Arthur Max's production design deserves a special nod. Shoutout to the art direction team, who did splendid work for this movie.Letizia Santucci's set decoration was brilliant. Janty Yates' costume design was superb. The hair-makeup department worked miracles and magic - everything they did to transform the main characters was exceptional. All other crew members did beautiful work for ""House Of Gucci"".Right off the bat, allow me to state for the record that Lady Gaga was the fire that burned in this film's hearth. Her dramatized portrayal of and performance as Patrizia Reggiani was one of her best acting to date. Her relaxed confidence leaped off the screen at every turn.Adam Driver played Maurizio Gucci with skilful aplomb - he was reserved but proud. Al Pacino gave Aldo Gucci a powerful presence, in keeping with his unmatched 'screen skill'. Jeremy Irons was, as always, masterful - he gave Rodolfo Gucci that 'just right' sense of being. Jared Leto played Paolo Gucci in ways that I cannot see anyone else repeating anytime soon - such sublime makeup prosthetics as well.Domenico De Sole (played by Jack Huston) was great. Pina Auriemma (played by Salma Hayek) was good. Paola Franchi (played by Camille Cottin) was quite good. Tom Ford (played by Reeve Carney) was remarkable. Benedetto Ceraulo (played by Vincenzo Tanassi) was good.The movie did have several dramatized elements, but it was based on real-life moments and experiences pertaining to the legendary 'House of Gucci', a name so synonymous with fashion and 'haute couture' you can't visualize the industry without it.It tracked the story of a woman, Patrizia Reggiani, whose humble origins did not discourage her from desiring more out of life. She gradually met and married Maurizio Gucci, and married well indeed. But for the fact that his father kicked him out. She stayed with him regardless.The time eventually came when Rodolfo, still refusing to take Maurizio back into the fold, unwittingly encouraged his brother Aldo to do so. With key support from Patrizia, Maurizio became the son Aldo never had. Aldo believed his own son Paolo to be useless, despite Paolo being passionate about design (at which he was mediocre). Maurizio's father and cousin grew scathingly unaccepting of Patrizia, whom they later saw only as a golddigger and manipulator.Patrizia's ambitions started to shake the Gucci boat (rather, ship) in dangerous ways. Her persistent actions to have Maurizio claim the family name, business, and wealth only inspired betrayal and revenge, all the while being surrounded by opulence, style, and power.She wanted more, especially when Aldo 'changed his tune'. Patrizia had plenty of reasons to strategize Aldo's fall from grace, owing in large part to how much she felt disrespected by select members of the family, not to forget her own low-income background constantly reminding her of what to avoid going back to.Her sincere love for Maurizio also spoke to her character. She eagerly wanted him to own his legacy, and get the inheritance due him. But in the end, as with most women who placed the crown on their husband's heads, the husband ignored the wife's contribution and moved on. That's when Patrizia Reggiani's claws truly revealed themselves, and the revenge train started to growl its way to murder central.While some elements of the movie were intentionally dramatized, the film still managed to capture the family's penchant for elegance, flair for style, and a near-ruthless aim for power and prestige in the realm of fashion. Strangely enough, that lattermost point was best portrayed by the outsider who married in.""House Of Gucci"" from MGM was akin to a sip of beautiful poison that tasted like fine wine.

Lady Gaga is a convincing Patrizia Reggiani, an Italian girl from the Province of Modena who wanted to achieve more in life. Hunting for a potential rich man she goes to parties and at one of these she meets Maurizio Gucci (portrayed by Adam Driver).The story of Patrizia and Maurizio Gucci, their rise and fall, the dynamics of manipulation, betrayal at the cost of trust around this family and its business is well set, though evolves a bit slow. The best performance in the movie by far though was by Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci, Maurizo's cousin.Overall, it is an entertaining movie portraying a story about a family, about a brand and a tragedy.

tt11214590,ur7033348,4,4 February 2022,"An uneasy mix of satire and serious drama. HOUSE OF GUCCI seems to start off well, with a tongue-in-cheek background story. Maurizio meets Patrizia, things go quite well, then they don't. I don't know how much license the film makers took in writing this, but it would be plausible if done in a straightforward way. The problem is basically one of tone. There's campy (but rarely funny) turn by Jared Leto as Paolo, the ""idiot"" cousin, and sometimes funny one by Al Pacino--fairly subdued, but with his trademark smoldering rage under the surface, controlling it to a big outburst manages to work. But that won't rescue the movie from too many quiet dialog scenes that add little to the story and the fluctuating Italian accents that would be funny if the whole thing were more sure of its purpose. No one here deserves an award for acting, but some are better than others. Lady Gaga is pretty good (though she mispronounces here husband's name as ""Morizio""). It's rare to see Adam Driver smile so much and he brings some charm to the early scenes. Some old chestnuts of Italian opera are sprinkled in the soundtrack, never tellingly and some others, like Andy Williams doing a holiday song, and 80s-period disco hits seem jarringly incongruous. Also, for a movie dealing with a fashion house, the color range is consistently wan. This seems an odd choice of material for Ridley Scott.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur7033348/?ref_=tt_urv

Gaga, Driver, and Leto all deliver stellar skills to their roles and elevate the overall experience. Undoubtedly, their acting is worth the price of admission and the clear centerpiece of the movie. Leto vanishes into his makeup and provides the perfect amount of pathetic comedy, Driver is forceful with his quiet deceit, and Gaga pilots the show with madness cloaked in charisma. Meanwhile, the direction of Ridley Scott is assured and steady, giving space for the cast to shine and accenting the narrative with touches of glamour.However, while House of Gucci is certainly very good, its technical aspects prevent it from being unequivocally great. The music and production design are both very strong because they convincingly capture the era and extravagant lifestyle, but beyond that, there isn't much filmmaking that stands out here. The imagery, editing, and sound are all proficient, but none are used in any particularly memorable way. Therefore, House of Gucci just isn't quite complete enough to be iconic as a whole.

tt11214590,ur48308095,5,24 November 2021,"Ridley Scott assembled an all-star cast for his period crime drama ""House of Gucci,"" but unfortunately the film's quality doesn't match the talents of those involved. The film tells the story of the relationship between Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) and Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga,) as Maurizio tries to exert greater control over Gucci and expand its financial footing. Despite what the trailers may have you believe, most of the movie isn't about the assassination of Maurizio. While the film tries to settle on a variety of tones and plot points to emphasize, it ends up being a giant mess on many levels.The performances are a mixed bag, as each of the main actors seems to be acting as if they are in a different movie from one another. Adam Driver tries his best as an ambitious, no-nonsense Gucci, but performance lacks range and can feel cold at times. Lady Gaga is mostly solid, although some might feel that she overacts a little. Al Pacino is good, but unfortunately underused. Jared Leto's character is almost cartoonishly annoying and ridiculous. The screenplay isn't terrible, but it is rather generic and contains tons of unnecessary filler. Even scenes that could be potentially interesting on paper, such as a masquerade party where Maurizio and Patrizia met for the first time, are stripped down to predictable clichés when shown on screen. The film's aesthetics are uneven. As one might expect, the costumes are gorgeously and intricately detailed, while the cinematography of northern Italy is often potent. Yet the film suffers from poor editing, as some scenes are punctuated or accentuated by a quick finishing or starting cut to another moment that seems wholly unnecessary or abrupt. Yet ""House of Gucci""'s biggest flaw is simply that it is just dull and often boring. By failing to make its primary characters engaging or stick to a well-paced narrative structure, viewers may question whether the film really needs to be 157 minutes long. It's unfortunate that this film ended up being a misfire, given that both Ridley Scott and the talented actors making up the film's ensemble cast are capable of so much better. Not recommended. 5/10.",109,147,/user/ur48308095/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur65144138,5,1 December 2021,"I don't think I've ever been more excited for a movie purely based off set photos than I have been for House of Gucci. As soon the first images of Adam Driver and Lady Gaga came online I was instantly interested in what this movie could be. All the set videos of over the top characters shouting at each other in Italian accents reminded me of the larger-than-life style of A Very English Scandal (one of my favourite miniseries of all time) and I wanted this film to tell this ridiculous story in an equally ridiculous way. Unfortunately the moments of energy and humour are few and far between and every impactful moment in the trailers simply came across as bland and uninteresting in the final film.But to mention the positives first, the film has a stellar cast all of whom did the best with what they were given. I haven't listened to much of Lady Gaga's music but as an actress she's consistently impressed me with her work and she's great here. I thought she pulled of the accent very well and the subtleties she gives off when her character starts to sink her hooks into the Gucci family was very well done. I can certainly see why Jared Leto's performance is dividing so many people as it's very loud and hyperbolic to the point of absurdity, for me though that's what I wanted this film to be so whenever he was on screen I was at least some what more engaged and I though the makeup transformation of the character was fantastic. I'm so glad to see that The Irishman wasn't just a one off and that Al Pacino is still capable of giving great performances. For me he was the best part of this movie as we able to have comedic scenes as well as moments of sentiment played in a subdued way, he was one of the few characters to have any sort of an impact on me. Jeremy Irons wasn't in the film as much as I would've liked but I thought he, like everyone else, did the best job with what he was given. I think Adam Driver suffers the most from the lazy script as his character feels extremely under written but I still felt he pulled of a good performance despite the lack of any real direction for his character.It's also worth noting that the film does start out with a promising 1st act. While not perfect, most of the memorable lines and scenes are in the first 45 minutes and the characters started out in a place that I was interesting to see to play out. Unfortunately the film doesn't achieve anything interesting with it's characters or it's story and that's ultimately down to Ridley Scott. I never thought I would've said this but House of Gucci is one of the worst directed movies I've seen in 2021. It's not because it's messy or even incompetent but simply because there is absolutely no style to it. The cinematography is bland as it possibly could be, there is not a lively edit in the entire runtime and Scott doesn't do a single interesting thing with the camera when the opportunity presents itself. As a result of this none of the emotional or shocking moments have any sort of impact but that is also down to the paint-by-the-numbers script that feels more like a Wikipedia synopsis of real events than an actual screenplay with any kind of perspective on this fascinating story. I was bored to tears for most of the 2nd and 3rd acts and I felt every moment of the overlong 157 minute runtime. Whenever the film does have moments of levity or energy they just seem to stick out more as nothing else in the film feels like it's on the same wave length.In the end, House of Gucci is a mediocre and frustrating biography that could have been so much more. While I think the cast all do good work with the material they are given they can only lift such a generic script up so far. There is not a single interesting technique used behind the camera in this entire film and I'm just left baffled as to why Scott chose to take on this project if he was content to revert to shot/reverse shot for the entire runtime. As someone who's been following this movie all year I couldn't have been more disappointed in the final product of what I thought had the potential to be one of the best movies of the year and one of Ridley Scott's best films. Thank god Scott also had The Last Duel come out this year otherwise I don't think I would be able to get myself excited for another project of his any time soon.5.7/10 - C (Mediocre)",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur65144138/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur0359842,4,2 December 2021,"Some movies, no matter how long they are, breeze by, and you're so engaged that you could sit for six hours if it's asked of you. House of Gucci's 158 minutes felt double that, as I sat aware of each minute slowly tick, its runtime reduced into the arduous task of both begging to be engaged in the picture, and just waiting for it to be over.It has a lot going for it - a great cast and Ridley Scott, and a scandalous true-crime story that at least holds promise as a flamboyant saga of dynastic unraveling. Maybe a clever comment on wealth, excess and materialism? Sadly, my expectations were totally thwarted, and I noticed instead that my mind was mostly occupied with deconstructing what had all gone wrong here.The broad strokes of the story are not the problem. We meet two factions of the Gucci family: the operating chairman Aldo (Pacino) and his talentless sad-sack son Paolo (Leto); on the other side is the elderly patriarch Rodolfo (Irons) and his son Maurizio (Driver), a potential heir to the company, except for the fact that he's studying to be a lawyer, and his stilted personality doesn't exactly shine of Gucci flamboyance. The wrench in the wheel is the charming, gold-digging Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), who chooses Maurizio as her mining target, and once integrated into the Gucci fold she begins to manipulate the direction of the company via her pathetic husband. Eventually hell breaks loose.The first problem is apparent in the opening moments, which is the awkward and critical error of making a group of great actors cosplay as Italians. None of them seem very comfortable doing it, or adept at it - even Lady Gaga, who is probably the best of the bunch. Pacino still sounds New Yawk, Irons British, Driver like a tourist, Leto - I don't even know what planet he was on. This aspect of the film made it hard to suspend disbelief from the get go, and was mostly inadvertently cringey.The worst is the fat suited Jared Leto, an actor I sometimes get tired of. He needs a director to reign him in for his talent to shine, or else when left to his devices he comes across as the obnoxious ego-driven comic mugging to be the center of every scene's attention. His weird take on Paolo Gucci neither helped the picture, nor his fellow actors around him to rise. His persona and accent, and whole vocal falsetto-thing was grating - despite strangely being one of the few to get some of the intonation right. His perpetual 'bouf' exclamation made me want to throw my shoe at the screen.It was hard to sympathize with any of these people or invest emotionally into their destinies. The Gucci family, as portrayed in this film are either all scheming, or nitwits. This needn't be a deal breaker - good films can be made of bad people - but we still need to be interested in what happens to them. The key relationship, between Lady Gaga's (scheming) Patrizia, and Adam Driver's (aloof) Maurizio is flat, and as a result we don't care. The tragedy is that Lady Gaga is a gifted actress, and delivered the most convincing performance overall, and it's frustrating to see her talent buried under a mess of so many uneasy elements.The best scenes in the film come when Patrizia arrives in St. Moritz to meet her wary husband, who already has eyes for another woman, and tries to act confident in the face of tension between them, and lay claim to him among people she is not accustomed to having to prove herself to. Everything beautiful about her as Patrizia is suddenly reduced to something garish, and there's a vulnerability to the front she puts on that is intriguing. The contrast between the insulated world of the Gucci and 'the outside world' is fleetingly of interest, and I wish there would have been more of those moments. Instead, for most of the film we are stuck inside padded kingdoms, with nothing to expose how screwed up these people are, or anything that might challenge their shows of excess, wealth, and spoiled personalities. In a way, the movie does a very good job of validating all of that.Ridley Scott is a master, but he's so prolific that even he is prone to misfire. He excels at the overall look and design, but when he's given a bad script, he sometimes will just shoot it anyway. The script here is not very good, nor sharp; it's disorganized, and lacks propulsion. It doesn't even succeed in the realm of outrageous tabloidism, which at least would have made it fun (I, Tonya comes to mind). They were never going to win the approval of the Gucci family for this film, so they might as well have swung for the fences and gone for over-the-top, but something about it feels too safe and rote, occupying a swampy middle ground where I don't know how seriously I'm meant to take all of this.With a major overhaul on the screenplay and tighter editing, it could have possibly been saved, even with these weird performances, but unfortunately the movie just stranded me way out to sea, and left me scratching my head more than anything, asking how this all went so pear shaped.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur0359842/?ref_=tt_urv

The reason for it being so watchable is mainly down to it's great cast.Lady Gaga and Adam Driver are terrific in totally different ways as Gaga plays it fairly big (like most in the movie) while Adam Driver is so reserved. Driver is fantastic in the film (maybe the best) and portrays the character so well as someone who is deep inside himself and always thinking and calculating, it's a marvellous performance.Al Pacino & Jared Leto are great too as father and son and at first both performances can seem to be a little too much but once you get what they are going for it works a treat. Jeremy Irons also deserves a mention in a smaller but pivotal role at the beginning.The only problem cast wise is Salma Hayek and not because she is bad. She isn't in it much and when she does get limited screen time there isn't much to go on. Her relationship with Lady Gaga isn't fleshed out enough and considering the film is over 2 and a half hours, maybe they could have done more with it.The movie is still an enjoyable time and will probably end up with multiple oscar nominations.

Once again, he convinces his audience besides the poor screenplay. The merit of this movie is concentrated in the star performances and Scott's direction. But the biggest star of this movie is indisputably Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci. He shines in every scene he's in, bringing some fresh air in a 2 1/2 hours movie.There aren't much to say about the screenplay, it's just another usual biography of a fashion Italian family where lust, greed, money, and power are the subject.

In this movie Patrizia ( Lady Gaga) stalks and then persuades young Maurizio Gucci ( Adam Driver) to get married to her. Thus she manages to enter into the Gucci family. She then slowly starts manipulating her husband and the family members ( Uncle Al Pacino and his son Jared Leto) to gain a hold on the finances of the company. Her ambition and greed not only ruins family relationships but it eventually leads to scandals and murder. I feel this film is a major achievement of director Ridley Scott who once again proves( if proof was necessary) that he is hugely talented. In his capable hands an excellent screenplay has been converted to an engrossing movie which despite its inordinately long duration of 2hours 38 minutes keeps the audience hooked. At no point did I find the the narrative sagging or boring. A highlight of the the film is the first rate acting of Lady Gaga who brings out the shades and nuances of her complex character with great conviction. She is possessive, greedy, ambitious and all set for revenge and betrayal. The other actors Adam Driver, Al Pacino and Jared Leto have provided fairly good support. Adam as the passive husband on the receiving end, Al as the helpful uncle and Jared as a foolish son all play their parts well. However the Italian accent appears to have been overdone and Leto's dialogue delivery is jarring.The cinematography is first rate and there are some good songs of the 70s and 80s which pep up the proceedings.

tt11214590,ur57396250,8,6 December 2021,"""House of Gucci"" is a sophisticated true-life tale about the way that power actually works: in a business empire, in a family, among people who are supposed to be looking out for each other. As Patrizia (Lady Gaga) and Maurizio (Adam Driver), with their nearly rhyming names, settle into their modest life and give birth to a daughter, the film introduces the other members of the Gucci clan. There is Aldo (Al Pacino), Rodolfo's (Jeremy Irons) brother and the co-owner of the company. Aldo and Rodolfo have a cooperation kind of relationship. Both feed off the company that has made their family wealthy and was started by their father in Tuscany, where they still cultivate the cows that produce the magic Gucci leather. Rodolfo is the artistic purist, lost in the past, where Aldo is always seeking ways to commercialize the brand. Then there's Aldo's son, Paolo (Jared Leto), a frustrated designer who dresses in things like lavender corduroy suits. He thinks he's got talent but does not.This is a movie in which Maurizio gets cut out of the family, then re-joins it, only to see his wife take over, but she flies too close to the sun, so she has to get cut out too, at which point Maurizio thinks he's king of the hill, but then, as he reinvents the company, hiring the unknown Texas designer Tom Ford (Reeve Carney) to bring it into the 21st century.My first thought was why was this story never filmed before? As unbelievable as the story is, the more believable are the acting performances. Lady Gaga, Adam driver and Jared Leto are sure delivering Oscar performances.

This movie fails on all the three levels. First of all is boring, slow and nothing really interesting happens. Things happen and the scenes where there was an intent to have an emotional weight are flat. Finally the message of the movie is discrediting the Gucci family without any reason for that, like if the director's wife had slept with one of the members. Because I did some researches after the movie and the real events are often different and the changes made lead to a worse image for the Gucci family.

What doesn't help with being able to follow the story is the editing in this movie. The editing in this movie made it feel like different clips just mashed together to make a movie. Most of the time the editing for this movie just cuts away to a different scene with zero transition and it's very startling. With both of these combined, it's obvious that the pacing of this movie isn't the greatest.

It was interesting to see how he portrayed the development of his character and how different he was from when the movie started to end. I mentioned that the only actor that didn't impress me was Jared Leto, who plays Paolo Gucci, and that's because I feel like he was given a completely different script than everybody else. His performance would've been perfect for the original movie I thought this was going to be but, in the end, he stood out like a sore thumb.

Well mostly for the curiosity of the performances.It's funny Ridley Scott criticized millennials for the failure of his other movie this year but he didn't stop to consider that maybe failures can take place on the other side.. My first critic is one that I have been doing multiple times to many films - why on Earth are you creating a biographical story that fully takes place in a foreign country, involving foreign people and you hire American actors to do funny accents?It's already a terrible decision and if you add this to the poor work on the accent done by the cast you get this result... No matter how talented the actors and actresses are, the accent is so inconsistent on this movie, going from weird, to non-existent to even cartoonish (yeah Jared Leto what was that about?) its simply a failure and it makes the story way less credible - you have one of the most multi cultural country in the world take advantage of that and have the guts to make a movie with actors from the country where the story takes place!The movie is long and yet somehow the director managed to make critical events happen at light speed, the sudden personality change of Maurizio comes out of nowhere... there's no character evolution there is a ton of set up to the plot, a lot of pointless scenes and the most critical changes of the character seem to be hidden somehow since from one scene to another there's a sudden change of personality for the main character.Again there's a lot of amazing actors in this flick but they all seem lost and each seem to be acting on their own as if they are in a different movie.. this is mostly notorious with Jared's character I don't know what they wanted to aim but his performance is borderline ridiculous.Props to the makeup department and the custom design but that's about it, pointless story about a pointless industry with American actors playing funny stereotypical Italian-American accents...",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur36922988/?ref_=tt_urv

But this backstory is fragmented, jumps through the nearly 20 years it depicts and doesn't manage to grip.Is it a drama? Kind of, yes. But the characters are too onedimensional, their motivations are non-existant, because the character developments just happen without having a clue throughout the story.Is it about the fassion business or about the business of Gucci? No. There is some name dropping and there is some mentioning about financial problems and missing success concerning the brand Gucci, there is even an unmotivated Gucci fassion show at the end of the movie, but it's all too puzzled together, too unmotivated, too unfocussed told.What about the actors, are they good?Jeremy Irons is excellent, some scenes of Lady Gaga are good, she can act, no doubt. I don't know what Al Pacino, Jared Leto or Salma Hayek in a minor role are doing. The support cast is ok. The characters are not interresting at all.Any good things in this movie?Yes: good set design and production values. Some good music from the 70s and 80s.

tt11214590,ur118679533,5,26 November 2021,"The second Ridley Scott film of this year is here! After his medieval epic The Last Duel flopped brilliantly at the box office, he can expect more in this respect with House of Gucci. Not only is Gucci one of the most famous and prestigious fashion brands, Lady Gaga is also in the lead role. I guess the strong fanbase of the singer will not be asked a second time. In the film, she suddenly finds herself part of the Gucci dynasty and becomes the protagonist of a toxic power struggle.Yet Gaga is still a relative unknown in Hollywood-speak. She made her big breakthrough in the 2018 music film A Star is Born. Scott, as he did in The Last Duel, has assembled an incomparable star ensemble. Adam Driver, who seems to be establishing himself as the director's new darling, evergreens Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons and an unrecognisable Jared Leto embody the key roles in the Gucci clan. In addition, Salma Hayek emerges as a kind of mentor for Gaga's character. But who is Gaga playing anyway? She is the young and rebellious Patrizia Reggiani. An extroverted perennial who worms her way into the millionaire family with charm and fascination. She is courted by the ambitious Maurizio Gucci, played by Driver, who actually wants to leave the intrigues and sometimes shabby business dealings of his predecessors behind. Once he falls in love with Patrizia and marries her, he is left with no choice but to get involved again. Driver and Gaga share a very passionate chemistry in the first act, which you fully buy into with little dialogue and through pure body language. While Driver plays rather reserved and shy, this quality emanates especially from Gaga, who doesn't hold back in any of her intimate scenes. At least the two characters are able to unfold their own approaches here. But when Al Pacino's character Aldo Gucci, Maurizio's uncle, insists on his nephew's re-entry into the family business, the two lose all closeness to each other. Rather, it is only an extremely manipulative relationship that both actors have to show in a few scenes. All the more Aldo and his son Paolo Gucci, portrayed by Leto, come to the fore. From this point on, the film lapses into a few minutes of megalomania, largely due to Leto's performance. He is exclusively eccentric and desperate and all in all a tragic figure. Whether you find this Super Mario caricature brilliant or miserable is a matter of interpretation.House of Gucci begins extremely quietly and shows the rise of the lovers in well-done visual sequences. The performances are generally fitting and although the film seems anti-Italian, I love it when Adam Driver cruises through Milan on his Vespa. But as interesting as the pecking order and hierarchy within the Gucci family is, from the second act onwards the film devolves into an overplayed and hyperactive tragedy that, despite the craziness of its scenes and actors, actually manages to be long-winded. Fashion, creativity and the business idea are not a theme at all, which in no way brings us closer to this brand that is so present. In the end we have a family epic (the film lasts 2 ½ hours), with exclusively unsympathetic characters. One more request to Ridley Scott: just let your actors speak English and don't embarrass them with Italian stereotypes with accents.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur118679533/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur0394738,3,6 December 2021,"I was excited to see this film but ultimately spent the majority of the film checking my watch. It has absolutely nothing to do with Gucci as a designer or how the house of Gucci became established. Maybe I should have done a little more research before going to see the movie, but it was basically just a screen version equivalent of Ryan Murphy's Assassination of Gianni Versace miniseries - and it FELT like you were sitting through an entire miniseries in one sitting. The man does not now how to edit - now I know why there are so many versions of Blade Runner. Again; didn't look into the film that much before seeing it, and just assumed it was a new and unpolished/untested director.Fair warning for anyone who has a sensitive bladder - go to the bathroom before leaving for the theater. I would tell you to time your bathroom breaks, but you're not going to miss anything of consequence, and getting up to go to the bathroom or get a refill on popcorn will actually feel like a welcomed break. I would have gone on my phone as a distraction had I not been worried about disturbing the other 5 patrons in the theater.It was basically Star Wars if they cut out all the battle scenes and just focused on all of the political meetings. This is what happens when directors are left unchecked and aren't held accountable to studio or audience input - usually it hurts the movie when studios interfere, but someone needed to step in and tell the guy to quit blowing hot air. It was just an exercise in overindulgence and drawn out scenes of little or no importance.Lady Gaga was fairly competent - if a little over dramatic. I actually didn't even realize Jared Leto was portraying the cousin. He was over the top and almost intentionally a completely inept putz, but to the point of a caricature (kind of like his Joker). You could tell he was trying to be a buffoon. And Adam Driver never looked more awkward and uncomfortable than usual - just a horrible casting decision, unless they were going for someone gangly and uncomfortable in their own skin, with no interest in fashion and just money/power hungry yet completely devoid of personality.It was just a drawn out expensive excuse for a nap. Seriously, don't waste your money - wait for it to come out On Demand or HBO so you can pause it or watch it in two or three sittings. Not to mention, the Italian accents are so bad, they're not believable at all (Jeremy Irons doesn't even try to hide his English accent, and Adam Driver phones in his attempt at an Italian accent - waiters at Olive Garden are more authentic).At least the Versace miniseries focused somewhat on some of his iconic designs and let you know what the focus was going to be on; this was all about business strategies and greed.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur0394738/?ref_=tt_urv

Everyone did actually do a great job in their roles. Where I believe things didn't align was in the way it was written and filmed.This was an incredible story. This was an awesome cast of actors who managed to do well in their roles / performances.But that didn't come through on screen. I wasn't captivated into their ""falling in love"" aspect of the story.

tt11214590,ur105044330,7,28 November 2021,"House of Gucci has only one problem and that's the writing which is very disorganized and cheesy. However, the acting alongside the directing and cinematography are absolutely spectacular. Although there might be a few mistakes and problems in them that are noticeable and make certain scenes seem ugly and cheap.Ever since A Star Is Born (2018), Lady Gaga has proved herself as a very talented actress that is able to portray a character accurately. She was amazing especially in terms of doing her accent and being able to transform into a different kind of person especially since her character goes through that transformation phase slowly through the whole film. Adam Driver is also amazing and kind of surprised me, I was expecting a good performance but I was not expecting a great performance. Shoutout to the make-up and hairstyle department for making Jared Letto completely unrecognizable. His acting completes his great performance alongside the great makeup and hairstyling. Even though the supporting cast like Al Pacino and Jermy Irons had less screentime than the other 3 main actors and actresses of the film (Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, and Jared Letto), but their presents left an impact on the film because they present a great performance as usual.This film is based on a true story and it tells the story on many different timelines in which the movie jumps suddenly without the audience would know which makes the film confusing at some points and hard to follow in terms of the events and timeline. In addition, the film takes so much time to tell a specific action and takes much more time than it is required to take only to tell the story and the rival competition that is happening between the Gucci family. Therefore, it would seem very boring because it is long and once every scene or action that happens is over, it does not have something special that would leave the audience with something to remember or memorize afterward which therefore makes the whole movie unforgettable and would not be revisited again. 2h 37m is for sure way too much for a film like that especially since it can be boring at times and hard to keep track on. At some points in the film, you will get bored and lose interest in the story even though it is an interesting one, but the representation is very bad. It is supposed to be a serious story that is represented seriously, in which it is represented in the complete opposite. It becomes a funny, cheesy, boring, and not interesting story at all. The film succeeds in terms of the comedy side which is something that is upsetting but entertaining at the same time. Upsetting because this is a story that should be serious and dark not funny snd cheesy. Entertaining because they are actually funny, any joke or a try from a certain character to make the audience laugh, are most of the times successful and indeed funny and entertaining.Most of the time the song choices would not fit a certain scene or action that is shown which makes the scene very cheesy and ruins it as it becomes annoying just because of one bad annoying song that does not fit or go with the action that is happening. The custom designs are obviously great because it is a film that is about ""GUCCI"", so what do u expect other than good-looking customs? The cinematography and camera movements work perfectly alongside the set design to present stunning images that are very catchy to the eyes.Finally, House of Gucci is disappointing especially that its story is very interesting and has a great cast and big names like Adam Driver, Lady Gaga, and Al Pacino. However, the writing completely ruined it and made the film easy to forget and would not be revisited again.My rating is 7/10

tt11214590,ur57999530,6,1 December 2021,"The trailers for this sold people on a movie with a completely different tone than what we got in the final product. They led me to believe that this would be a high energy black comedy, kind of like Wolf of Wall Street. And I think the movie would've been much better if it decided to go down this path. Some might argue doing this would've been disrespectful to the real people that these events have occurred to like with Pain & Gain. I can understand this sentiment but I enjoyed Pain & Gain quite a lot as trashy and offensive as it was at times. It made me wish that someone else directed this. Maybe not Michael Bay even though it would've been very entertaining if he did. Someone like Martin Scorcese would've been perfect for this, this is the kind of movie he can make in his sleep. His high energy style is what this movie needed as Ridley Scott just makes it feel too serious and lethargic. That style is perfect for something like The Last Duel but not for a story with a cast of colorful characters scheming and plotting.Another gripe of mine is the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. I'm getting tired of his washed out , bleak style of shooting movies. That style worked great in the Last Duel or even in All The Money in the World or Alien Covenant but a movie set in the fashion world needed more swagger and vibrancy. The cinematography looks so cold that it doesn't gel at all with the energetic pop songs that this film utilizes at every turn. The songs feel forced and none of them feel like they belong or add energy to the scenes. Once again, if Scorcese made this movie and he had the same songs to work with, I bet he would find the perfect use for them to enhance scenes.Now, it's not all bad as the story was entertaining and I didn't really know where it was headed but unfortunately a lot of it felt rushed, especially towards the end. The film lacks focus as it can't decide which plot it wants to concentrate on, it's kind of all over the place. On the other hand, the acting is great across the board apart from the dreadful accents. Once again, the Last Duel did this perfectly with English standing in for French without the actors doing any accents. I prefer actors skipping accents altogether like Sean Connery in the Hunt for Red October to them speaking English with an accent. However, this aspect doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie especially with Jared Leto doing a very comical over-the-top Italian accent which will go down in history of cinema as one of the worst accents ever. Some are criticizing him but I loved Jared in this movie. His campy style of acting is exactly what the movie needed more of to make it more of a dark comedy.

Now to House of Gucci, I feel like the movie simply wants to tell a story that I couldn't relate to. Is the film about the renewal and iteration of a fashion empire, the subtle realization that led to the collapse of a marriage, or the prosperity and demise of a proud family? The right timing of incidents, tear, and sex gives the audience with just the right amount of every different impressions. However, the aftertaste is plain -- ""that was such a formatted movie"" I thought to myself. Ridley Scott needs to focus on what he, as a director, would like to shout out to the audience, instead of shooting everything from the script. Lastly, let's take some time to applaud to the devotional actors and actresses: Lady Gaga with her unsatisfied, active, and insecure Lady Gucci, Jared Leto's dramatic, incompetent, and tragic Pablo Gucci, along with Al Pacino performing the respectable, vivacious, prideful businessman, Aldo Gucci.

tt11214590,ur94233651,5,9 December 2021,"Life is short. The time people have on planet Earth should be spent living life to the fullest and spending time committing to activities that bring happiness. This is why I suggest skipping the new two hour 40 minute Ridley Scott biopic HOUSE OF GUCCI, despite the substantial amount of talent involved. The movie boasts an all-star cast and one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood, yet never seems to bring the quality content that everyone expected from such a high-profile project. It could be perhaps the story which holds the movie back from being memorable -- the whole runtime seems to be spent building up to the one interesting event that occurs at the very end of the film -- but the true culprit seems to be a mix of the painfully dull writing and direction. Both are serviceable enough to keep the movie from being anything resembling horrible, but they are so average that the story of the Gucci legacy becomes about as interesting as skimming through a long scholarly essay on the subject.The story of the Gucci family is a long and dramatic one, or so the HOUSE OF GUCCI movie expresses. It starts when Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), a woman working within her father's modest garbage truck company, meets Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), the main heir to the Gucci house, during a lively club party. The two almost immediately hit things off due to Reggiani's perseverance, and things escalate from there, resulting in their marriage and her inclusion into the business dealings of the rich family. However, it soon starts to become clear that love is not the only thing on Reggiani's mind, and tensions begin between family members as she pushes her way further into the Gucci family's dealings. The entire future of the Gucci dynasty becomes a game of corruption, greed and even murder.The main reason to see HOUSE OF GUCCI is the acting. Lady Gaga commands the screen in a way that becomes unprecedented the more one thinks about her quick transition from pop stardom to A-list actress. She and Adam Driver, who brings his typical A-game, work wonders together and inject electricity in each scene they co-star in. The supporting work is strong as well, with veteran actors Jeremy Irons and Al Pacino delivering performances that remind the audience why they are some of the best actors alive . The only weak link in this regard is Jared Leto, who delivers an ambitious yet distracting performance that never fits in with the rest of the film. Leto attempts to bring a sort of comic relief to this heavily dramatic narrative, which has caused many critics to claim that HOUSE OF GUCCI is a campy and self-parodying biopic. If this is the case, then it does a terrible job at maintaining this tone for all of the characters, and if the movie is truly just a drama, as I believe it is, then the odd humor is a misguided attempt to add some flavor to an utterly tasteless film.HOUSE OF GUCCI starts out on a positive note: most of the scenes near the beginning involve Gaga and Driver developing their romantic chemistry, and these scenes work beautifully due to the amazing performances. However, once the rest of the movie's drama enters the picture and viewers find themselves wrapped up in a convoluted crime saga ripe with double-crossings and financial meetings, the film becomes difficult to sit through without checking the time or taking a nap. Ridley Scott's direction doesn't add much of anything to the picture either, proving that Scott only thrives if he has a quality script brought to his front doorstep. Add on top of this some very bland cinematography, underwhelming production design, and a horrible depiction of the passage of time within the movie, HOUSE OF GUCCI just turns into a typical biopic -- not great, not horrible, but just a film that exists.It really is a shame that HOUSE OF GUCCI comes across as such an average attempt to make the Goodfellas of the fashion world. Scott has come under fire recently for attacking Marvel superhero movies for their terrible scripts, which just seems ironic given every recent Marvel film has a better script than this hot mess. The movie excels at small things like costume design because, after all, it is about Gucci, but none of the technical aspects or stellar performances are enough to make the film interesting on a human level. The cardinal sin that HOUSE OF GUCCI commits is that the movie never gives the audience an insight into any of the characters' true feelings or complexities. Viewers can see the events that supposedly occurred, but not once did I feel like I was delving into the thoughts of Reggiani or any of the Gucci family. Because of this, HOUSE OF GUCCI ends up feeling inferior to the Wikipedia entries of any of the real-life characters.

tt11214590,ur43102122,9,26 November 2021,"House of Gucci ensembled a magnificent group of actors with an actress in Lady Gaga leading the line of duty. After her performance in 'a star is born' I was intrigued to see what she could bring to this role and I must say she didn't disappoint. I must say I was never really a big fan of her music although I always respected the artistic music videos I saw of hers. Alongside her she is spoilt for choice with unlimited talented actors. Brought to us by one of my favourite directors in Ridley Scott we get to explore the Gucci family in all their glory. Ultimately we see the downfall of having a successful fashion brand; the target it puts on ones back and the dysfunctional family that comes from it. I particularly liked Jared Leto's performance as I felt he added a comedy element to the film, he was unrecognisable at times had I not known the cast beforehand. Lady Gaga has proved her worth as an actress as Patrizia Reggiani creating many layers and depth to her character. Firstly she displays integrity, is very stern, a lady with balls only to switch in contrast to an emotional damaged woman. Adam Driver gives a ruthless display in what originally seemed all charm and innocence. Al Pacino plays Aldo Gucci, my personal favourite actor had a lot more to do than I thought, he'd come across like the peacemaker. He'd wanted everybody to like him alongside Jeremy Irons as Rodolfo Gucci who are the backbone of Gucci. Although Rodolfo Gucci is much more cautious, he has his guard up in what he feels is in the best interest of the Gucci family. Jared Letto plays Paolo Gucci, Pacino' son constantly trying to seek the approval of his ideas from his father, but Pacino's character is not in the slight bit interest and sees his son as dim to say the least. Mauricio (Adam Driver) is studying to be a lawyer and is son of (Jeremy Irons) character Rodolfo Gucci. When Maurizio bumps into Patrizia (Lady Gaga) at a party, much like Paolo can't get his fathers approval; the juxtaposition of Maurizio (Adam Driver) trying to convince Rodolfo of his new girlfriend, soon bride to be is equally proving as difficult. I thought the story had good contrast in characters with a great cast that was needed to pull it off. It's nice to see some compelling story telling in the cinema for a change compared with the usual CGI led projects of today.

tt11214590,ur46973713,3,14 February 2022,"Wow! Such an utter waste of big budget, acting talent and viewers' time!A dismal script makes for a limp, long and winding, pointless film.If the idea was to show that the whole Gucci family, in-laws included, were a bunch of thoroughly disreputable, unlikable characters, it somehow succeeds. But even that a film can do with wit and satirical acumen - think Barry Lyndon, among many other good stories infused in biting irony.Here there is none. Most of the characters are so one-sided lacking human depth that one feels as sorry for the strong actors as for oneself having to watch them slogging it out.Al Pacino gets possibly the worst, flattest dialogues of his whole brilliant career, endlessly repeating that his son is a complete moron, but how he has no choice but to do with him.Jared Leto is indeed the stupidest of the absurd fools - but he is also such a whining and excessively demonstrative faux-Italian one that each of his much too many repetitive appearances makes the viewer cringe, and wish more that it was him not his cousin who was killed, the faster the better.One feels sad for Jeremy Irons for the unforgiving small part he is given - but also puzzled by the almost comical zombie make-up inflicted on him.Salma Hayek's character is so weak and unconvincing that charity commands ignoring it - but for her bravery to have accepted to look so unrecognisably ugly.Adam Driver's Maurizio Gucci is an ever-grinning inconsistent cypher, different at each turn of the story from the previous one, progressively wasting any capital of interest and sympathy he might have earned at the start of the film.Even the widely-praised Lady Gaga performance, indeed to be hailed for its intensity and sincerity, does not compensate for the fact that her character is not much more than what it looks like, a selfish, greedy, possessive, calculating but small-minded, and not even particularly bright woman, devoid of any redeeming or even really interesting features - Lady Macbeth she certainly ain't.And if your interest is about a better grasp of the shenanigans of the fashion world, or even relishing its gorgeous productions, forget about it - it just appears randomly from time to time, here a lengthy discussion about whether Gucci should stoop to being sold in Japanese malls (?), there a pointless few scenes about the problem of counterfeiting, later a rushed Tom Ford show and barely understandable shareholder manoeuvres, everything crammed, none attention-catching, or giving an even remote idea about how such flawed, not obviously talented characters were able to build such a successful fashion empire.But what really killed the film for me was the extremely misguided idea of having all actors speak English with rather heavy Italian accents, most of them fake - acceptable if the story had taken place mostly in New-York, not Milano, and made even worse when a few Italian sentences pop up for no good reason from time to time. When you shoot Gladiator in English not Latin, everybody understands the practical reasons for that, and nonetheless you can produce a great, credible, make-believe story. So if you shoot a contemporary Italian story, either do it fully in Italian (even dubbing non-Italian actors, such as in the awesome The Leopard with Burt Lancaster and Alain Delon) - or acknowledge that English-speaking stars are safer for the box-office to recoup the costs of a big production; but please do not insult the intelligence of your viewers with the 100% false authenticity of painfully faked Italian accents.In the end, one gets out of the film rather angry, wondering how it has been able to attract so many good or even indulgent reviews.Could it be mainly the result of the sheer fascination, possibly glee, provoked among us ordinary mortals by a true story of low scheming and even (more uncommonly in the real world) murder among the rich and beautiful?Possibly, but one wishes it had been much more interestingly brought to the screen - even if one suspects that the actual characters might have been not much more interesting than their film personification.But cinema is mostly not about strict truthfulness - it is about reshaping reality to make it more intelligible and captivating.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur46973713/?ref_=tt_urv

With House of Gucci the first thing that jumped at me was the accents. Why in the world did they think it would be a good idea to have American actors speak with fake Italian accent? For authenticity? I am pretty sure the original characters spoke Italian amongst themselves, not accented English. For flavor? A flavor that is so obviously artificial makes things worse, not better.But first impression can't always be trusted. Surely I'll get engrossed in the story and the characters and will stop even noticing the accents. Sadly, the story turned out to be dull and slow paced, which I wouldn't mind if it weren't filmed in such a pedestrian, unimaginative way. Here Comes the Rain Again is playing and look, it's starting to rain! And Jingle Bells as a way to let us know it's Christmas?! In the Alps?! The two main characters Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) and his wife Patrizia (Lady Gaga) are flat and utterly unsympathetic. Lady Gaga is capable of being very raw, but she's doesn't have much to work with. There's literally a scene where Patrizia asks a psychic (Salma Hayek), ""Will I get what I want?"" and is repeatedly prompted for specifics, but can't give any. That's a problem. The two characters I did like were the elder Guccis, played by Jeremy Irons and Al Pacino. Interestingly enough, the former didn't even bother with fake Italian accent, just toned down his British. And the latter infused his character with so much humanity and warmth, I forgot to notice. It is such a brilliant, understated performance. He conveyed so much emotion even with his back to us, washing his son's dishes. He also helped make whole the character of his son Paolo played by Jared Leto. For most of the movie he seemed over the top, but towards the end, playing off Pacino, he emerged as the movie's biggest heartache.This is a story of a generational guard change in an ultra successful family business that gets hijacked by a gold digger who bulldozes her way into and over the family. But the tragedy didn't start with her. The men who built the brand were unable to produce heirs capable of taking over. What happened? I would have loved it if the movie looked into that rather than just gloss over. It could have given it depth, so badly lacking. But the filmmakers seemed more interested in scheming. We don't even really get to know what it was that made Gucci - Gucci. Quality? It's not like quality stuff hasn't been produced before. No pastels or browns?

When you watch interviews from Reggiani and directly compare the mime and gestures from Reggiani to Lady Gaga the similarities are stunning. Also Jared Leto performs very good. His character ""Paulo Gucci"" was a very extraordinary person back in the days. This makes him too a problem for the whole movie. His twirly behaviour and high spirits are very exhausting and annoying during the movie.

The first hour or so is highly intriguing and you quickly become immersed in 70s Italy, but from there and onwards the story simply spirals downwards. The story becomes slow and lethargic and also slightly tedious.While leaving the cinema and speaking to other viewers a common critique was the usage of an italian accent among the characters when speaking english. In hindsight it was a bit odd but it did not take away from my viewing experience in the slightest.Where this movie shines is in its aesthetics. Ridley Scott does an incredible job in immersing the viewers in the late 1900s Italy with the picturesque sets and stunning fashion. Even as someone not all that interested in clothes and fashion, one couldn't help but watch the dashing clothes and styling in awe.Another positive to take away from this film is the acting. Lady Gaga comes through with another great performance and the supporting cast housing the likes of Adam Driver and Al Pacino also put on some great displays.To summarize House of Gucci is a movie which the fashion-interested will love and if a rather slow movie with a lack of action doesn't bother you, you might like it too.

House of Gucci was a 3 hour long mess that should end her film career.My husband picked this movie because he was interested in the 1980's tax evasion case that the family was involved in. The actual investigation was glossed over in the film and quite forgettable.I originally didn't want to see this film because I read some quotes from Lady Gaga about why she didn't need to actually speak with the still living woman that she was portraying. Instead of it being a true biopic, Lady Gaga decided to play herself, but renamed Patrizia Reggiani, and with a bad Russian accent.Gaga had zero chemistry with Adam Driver's character and it felt like she was imposing herself on him to force a relationship. Her character was intrusive and transparent in motive.Adam Driver's character, Maurizio Gucci, seemed aloof and without agency. He was with Patrizia because he had never had a woman chase after him and from the film, you would think he had never been around women before at all. It felt like he was bullied into everything, which made his choices towards the end of the film seem out of character / confusing.Jared Leto's character, Paolo Gucci, was straight out of an SNL skit. His fake Italian accent sounded like ""it's a me, Mario!"" It felt out of place to have such an over-the-top American stereotype of an Italian dancing across the screen.*Spoilers if you don't know anything about this case.*After reading more about what actually happened in the Gucci family, not only was one of Maurizio and Patrizia's daughters not even mentioned, but the reason for the breakdown of their marriage and why Patrizia actually ordered the hit were not even mentioned.If you had only watched the movie, you would have believed that they were still married when the murder took place and that the hit was because she was angry about her husband not moving back in with her and their one daughter. This was not the case at all! In actuality, if her ex-husband got remarried, which he was planning to do, her alimony payments would be cut in half to only $800k a year instead of the more than $1 million per year.

I used to think Kevin Costner or Warren Beatty was the worst actor in Hollywood, then I saw Adam Driver lower the bar somehow.Ironically, he is not the biggest problem with the movie. The biggest problem with the movie is it sucks. It's easily the most vapid movie this decade. If this film were made well, it could only appeal to the most pretentious. Pompous and superficial audience who actually care about fashion brands.Princess problems aside, it tries to connect the drama of the Gucci family with Driver's marriage and a successful textile / fashion business.

""House of Gucci"" lives and dies with its cast, which is very good. Everybody who has read the trailer will know all the stars that are put on screen and I have to say for a this diverse cast the chemistry between all members is very good.Lady Gaga is especially brilliant. She finds the perfect balance between strong business wife and vulnerable woman. The other actors, albeit good are more in supporting role. Pacino can hold his own and Leto is more than capable, although he is overacting most of the scenes. Jeremy Irons is na thankless role and doesn't seem to really wanna play it. That leaves Adam Driver. The leading man is not really that. Driver is a more than capable actor as he has shown in recent years but in ""House of Gucci"" he doesn't seem to know what to do. He plays Maurizio Gucci not as a strong businessman but as a man who changes his persona with every person he meets. Driver never conveys the strength and power that would have come with his character.You notice I haven't said too much about the plot, that is because, like I said in the begging the story of the Gucci family is well known and I am sure most viewers just want a visual account from what they read on Wikipedia.I can say this, the story told well told but the movie is a little too long and drags in the middle part.What I particularly liked about the movie was the score. As you might expect the movie stretches over many decades. The movie manages to underline the scenes in every decade with a song from that decade or year the scene is in. I have rarely watched a movie where the underlying lyrics of a song fit so well to what I saw on screen and that in every scene.Apart form the music the production design really stands out. The beautiful villas and landscapes of Italy and the wonderful clothes and interiors are rally a sight to behold.Now, Ridley Scott is a very good director and although his medieval ""The Last Duel"" bombed at the box office (which is still a mystery to me as it was very good), he shows all his strength with House of Gucci. The movie doesn't feel so much like a biopic but rather like a family drama of epic proportions. It could be any family on screen being portrayed by these actors.""House of Gucci"" is one of those stories that needed to be told on screen, not because the people don't know it, but because it is an entertaining one and it makes for good drama. That being said, I am not sure how ""House of Gucci"" is going to hold up in the Oscar race but I am very sure it will score a few nods in the acting and music categories.

tt11214590,ur73501762,7,30 November 2021,"Overall I really enjoyed House of Gucci. Its not the scandalous, chic masterpiece we all wanted it to be, which isn't great considering how much talent was involved, but its not bad at all. I liked it! It's not Ridley Scott's best work either, even his other movie from this year ""The Last Duel"" is far superior, and this one feels like it could have benefitted from someone like Martin Scorsese directing. It felt like a mix of ""The Godfather"" and ""Succession"" while wanting to be the new ""Wolf of Wall Street"", but unfortunately it can't live up to any of those. Now, the problem isn't with the first two acts, those were fantastic and I was loving the movie for the first 2 hours. Unfortunately at about the 2 hour mark it just loses steam, slows down and loses focus of what it is. It just becomes a tonal mess, and even forgets about its main character. Heck, the whole murder plot feels like it is ignored and just brought up at the end just because. All the planning happens off screen, which is just ridiculous when that is literally what the movie was building up to. If it wasn't for that darn third act I would be raving about this movie, as it tells such an interesting and pretty much crazy true story, with some awesome production value and performances.The performances alone are enough reason to see the movie, though! I cannot believe how good all the actors were in this, I was blown away. Lady Gaga finally earned my respect as a serious actor, she is unbelievable as Patrizia, and fully becomes the character from her walk to her attitude and even voice. She truly deserves the academy award this time! Adam Driver is also stunningly good, he's just a powerhouse of an actor and delivers such an intricate and nuanced performance. Al Pacino was fantastic as well, and honestly this might be one of my favourite performances of his. But it was Jared Leto that truly surprised me, he is unrecognizable as Paolo (credit to makeup, hair and costuming teams), and truly doesn't even seem like himself in the character, it's something so new for him. He is also incredibly funny in the role, he had so many comedic moments that stole the show! There is one problem with the acting however; all the actors are perfect on their own, but they all feel like they have different ideas of what the movie is, they don't seem like their performances all mesh with each other. But this could also be the script... because these are some talented actors giving some of their best work!The script unfortunately is just amateurish. It's slightly too slow, and easily half an hour too long. Its main issue is that it's imbalanced and incoherent. It isn't sure what it wants to be; some scenes feel like they are from a serious drama and some from a goofily heightened melodrama. Both aspects were good, and done moderately well, but they did not make a for solid final product. There doesn't seem to be much focus. It also can be campy at times and some of the dialogue is pretty poor. The worst part is it isn't supposed to be a comedy, but some of the lighthearted/funny moments were the best parts of the movie, which makes me wonder why they didn't go with a full ""Wolf of Wall Street"" tone for it. And like I said, it also just completely loses itself and its characters in the third act. It also rushes through significant moments and jumps through the Gucci history, while it is slow and too long it also doesn't feel like it spends enough time with key moments.This also didn't help Ridley Scott with his direction. He really does seem to be held back by the script, and I'm surprised he couldn't manage to elevate the material, just left it to his actors. I really feel Scorsese would have been better for this movie, he really could have guided the tonally inconsistent script to success. The production value is wonderful at least, the film is a feast for the eyes, whether it be the cinematography, costuming or set design. It fits Gucci so well, its very chic and exudes luxury. I also loved the needle drops in the soundtrack too, all the songs were perfect and fit well!Overall despite its issues I still enjoyed and really liked the film!

tt11214590,ur39731436,5,25 December 2021,I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott. He does one epic film followed by a small film. All his smaller films are usually forgettable. This film is mediocre on every level. From the cinematography to the acting. We would have all been alright if this movie was never made.

tt11214590,ur110943005,1,2 February 2022,"...ed this movie! I have to say as a crime/drama this movie is a complete failure. 1 star. But, as a comedy, this movie is a solid 7 stars. No joke. This is an entire film full of extremely talented actors/actresses and a GaGa who all fail miserably at reproducing an even mildly passable Italian accent. It's quite stunning! I can only imagine the casting director had never actually met an Italian from Italy and the sets were full of yes people surrounding the ""talent"". Al Pacino did a very entertaining cross between an Italian speaking English and an Italian mobster from NY. Adam Driver sounded like a Russian Jew trying to flee Germany before WW2. Jeremy Irons sounded like one of the German Nazi's that would have been chasing him. GaGa's accent was about what you'd expect. Strange and constantly slipping back into her natural voice. Bad. The winner DEFINATELY goes out to Jared Leto who sounds like a mixture of a flamboyant overgrown baby Italian man and Christopher Walken. Listen to it again and you'll get it. You really will. My wife and I were cracking up for hours! You just have to imagine the giant egos these actors carry around and all the people on set way too terrified to tell their meal tickets that their accents are God awful. Once in a while when everyone is scared to upset these people you get a comic gem like this one. It's clear they all tried hard to put on a great show.

The pacing of the movie is great, but the intro is maybe too long, and the end a bit too short. I was awaiting more story in the end, what happened to Patrizia. The music was good, but a bit confusing to have disco tunes pumping on 80s-set scenes. Most of the acting performances were grand... Gaga and Driver play amazing character arches and developments during the entire movie. Some say Leto was a bit too much... maybe so, but it brought in some humor. Wasn't also a fan of the accents, or with some the lack of missing an accent. But overall it was camp, funny, I kept on being interested in the story and characters and had some amazing one-liners.

tt11214590,ur112709184,7,2 February 2022,"""House of Gucci"" is the new film by director Ridley Scott, a director who is highly acclaimed for films like Blade Runner, Alien or Thelma & Louise. The critics have been quite unfavorable, having a 59% on metacritic, but in my opinion, it was not THAT bad.This is a very difficult film to rate, because it's the type of movie that you hate or you love. The movie tells the story of the Gucci family, that founded the famous Gucci brand, and the killing of one of its most important members, Maurizio Gucci, portrayed by Adam Driver. And I'll start talking about the performances.Adam Driver does a really good job portraying an ambitious, a bit cold and obsessed with the power man, it's not one of his most brilliant performances, but it is really fine. Then Lady Gaga, I must say she didn't convince me for a great part of the movie. I thought she was a little bit exaggerated, and I didn't connect with her character. Towards the ending, her acting becomes really great, but for the most part of the movie, she wasn't so good for me. Jeremy Irons and Al Pacino are both excellent, the first doesn't last much in the movie, but his acting is enough. And Pacino is Pacino, his acting is really great. And finally, Jared Leto. I didn't like his performance, he's a really great actor, but his performance as Paolo Gucci felt really, really overreacted for me.In the technical aspect, everything was really great. Cinematography, costume design, production and all those aspects are really well done. I think the screenplay has some troubles with the passing, sometimes the movie is extremely frenetic, and then it falls and gets really slow, suddenly. But in general, all those aspects are fine. Also, the music choices and the soundtrack are all awesome, maybe my favorite part of the movie were the songs and how it felt during some moments, so it was a really great aspect.In conclusion, ""House of Gucci"" is a funny film, very entertaining, with a very interesting and suspenseful story, with some great performances, but that feels a little bit wasted, having some scenes that doesn't add anything to the plot, and that didn't really felt like a movie about Gucci.7/10.",0,1,/user/ur112709184/?ref_=tt_urv

He's targeting a viewer base of only 14%.Then the character in the trailer smoking seems pretty unlikeable. I'm sure Lady Gaga's performance is what was asked of her (she is very talented), but the character alone puts you off.So, Ridley, if you're wondering why your film failed the trailer did it for me. I don't want to see a nearly 3 hour advert for smoking, and for a character I really didn't care for.Smoking promotion in film is a pretty lazy prop. You could say in period dramas it's part of the culture of the time, but I'm willing to bet you could remove it and if you have the right script, right actors, and right director, nobody would notice.

There was no finesse there anymore and he just tends to go into that same character all the time now.Jared Leto playing his son was borderline offensive though, how on earth did his co actors keep a straight face?

tt11214590,ur56641546,7,15 December 2021,"The cast are phenomenal. You can make fun of the accents all you want, but at least they tried instead of just doing British accents as sub ins for everything. I think the major issue is that each actor has a voice so well defined that it's jarring to hear them doing something so broadly different. Adam Driver is on another level from any of his contemporaries. He's charming, shy, powerful, weak, fragile yet unshakeable. He can so easily play hero or villain and always delivers. Lady Gaga is good in the movie, and she has a lot to play, but I'd be lying if I said this was a real home run. There's a little bit of Ally in her that I just assume is inexperience. Where she really comes alive are in her scenes with Driver. They have such unique chemistry that reads as very manipulative and toxic, but also somewhat genuine. The scenes where she has to cry become less and less genuine in a very compelling way. It's not said enough how good Jeremy Irons is, and for his short time on screen I'm still thinking about his performance, and Al Pacino has entered something of a career renaissance. The movie is sort of dragged out, it could probably lose about 20 minutes, but there really is an easy fix for that. Cut everything to do with Jared Leto. I'm not even joking, before Jared Leto's first scene I had no problems with this movie. I've got no hate towards Jared Leto as a whole, but ever since he won an Oscar, he's been putting on these horrendous displays of vanity and ego. He is done up in so much makeup with this awful hairpiece, and he looks like a MadTv character. His accent is the only one in the cast that goes full Mario, with every single word being given the most Italian accent you've ever heard. He is the Jar Jar Binks of this movie, whenever he's on screen it is lowest common denominator jokes and absolute farce. There are a couple of scenes where he's ok, and those are the scenes where he just talks to people normally, but for the majority of the film he is this glaring, catastrophic, presence who draws attention to himself. There are some pacing issues, the film jumps around a bit, and certain events are glossed over until the epilogue. Although none of that distracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.

During the first family get-together I got serious Mad TV vibes, since it borders on parody the way everybody is characterized and talks in quite a stereotypical way. Jared Leto is the most indulgent one in this kind of performance which seemed ad-libbed at times because it often went on too long. Lady Gaga did very good especially in the beginning when she got something to do. We start off with her point of view, and it's mostly about her, until the movie makes a complete shift to Adam Driver's character, as if the director himself lost interest in the story of the protagonist.The script is very predictable with no turns or dramatic height, everything kind of happens in this film. It really felt like a run-off-the-mill television drama and not like a big cinematic opera. One would think that Ridley Scott would at least TRY to give this movie some blood.

The evolution and consequence of the seven deadly sins, patriarchy, and power-this is one key theme of this film that had a pretty solid follow through.It takes a little moment to take shape in Act One when following our lead character, played by Gaga; and even then it's mainly stated vs seen by ""father Gucci"" himself to his son, played by Driver. However, the quick focus on the Gucci family is what saves Act One's role in setting the theme in motion because the family itself is the theme.Act Two is all about Gaga's character being slowly immersed in the Gucci environment. We see her go from sampling the family lifestyle with a ""forced / testing"" humility, to taking advantage of the all you can have buffet, thus becoming a replica of them / the theme. Then, while this is happening, we see the patriarchy and power aspects of the theme emerge in response.Act Three is the collision of the theme on all characters involved.2. As my friend said, ""AND YOU SUGGESTED YO MAN FOR THE SHOW!"" That last lunch meeting in Act Three...3. But the outfits, though...4. When I tell you, Father Gucci was SO shady... #TheTriumphOfMediocrity5. House of Gucci tells the origin story of the now global luxury fashion line. I learned SO much from this film, and it was so juicy while also being effective in its execution.This film definitely holds true to its title, and the each act ensures we get the understanding, legacy, beliefs, and motivations of this family as it relates to the theme. Act One wastes no time with us being able to get a glimpse of both Gaga's character as well as the Gucci family separately, and then together. I also appreciated the slow merge with the 1-1 (Gaga and Driver) to then 2-1 (Gaga & Drive with father), and finally the blending of the families.Act Two is the complete dive into the Gucci family mainly through the lens of Gaga's character and her steering of the theme, and then Act Three... another perspective of ""when in Rome...""6. Personally, I found the pacing to be solid. Act One quickly gets Gaga into this family without it feeling rushed. Act Two is just a fun and scandalous pacing via Gaga with every convo, move, and visual feeling intentional and perfectly timed by frame.Act Three is where the debris from Act Two gets it juicy. A friend of mine who was with me felt the pacing started to slow down a bit at this point (he also was on his second glass of theater wine...lol), and I felt the start of Act Three move a little differently after going through Act Two, but it was brief and necessary to me. It wasn't long before the act picks up steam again. It was like driving on an open highway, then coming to that random short stretch of 2 lanes becoming 1 due to construction, but once you go through it you're back to speeding again...7. I didn't think seeing Salma and Gaga together would be one of the most entertaining duos on screen.8. When Gaga spoke to Franco about trying to teacher her child to not touch other people's stuff...9. ""You can call me Señora Gucci..."" #Periodt10. I adored every character performance, and every character carried the weight of the theme in their own way. I really enjoyed Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci who seems to be someone who embodied this internal battle of the virtue patience with the sin of envy and wrath, even though at times it felt like he was having a keekee session / queening out with Gaga (but I blame the chemistry and not him, which is also a good thing).Father Gucci who was the epitome vainglory. Uncle Aldo who embodied a form of gluttony and sloth-ness. Maurizio Gucci who had an amazing arc from embodying this virtue of humility to having aspects of his family rub off on him eventually. And then we have Gaga's character, Patrizia.Her arc and development was the strongest in acts 2 and 3-seeing this greed, vainglory, and wrath mold together. BUT...Act One doesn't explain much about her motivation. How the seed was planted. We do get this ""lust"" aspect from her, but again... why based on her life-context at the time...* * *

While her performance meets expectations after her unexpectedly great portrayal in A star is born I do not see the point for the accent. Throughout the movie knowing that these people are Italian and would have spoken in Italian and not in English with an Italian accent it was all a little surreal.As a movie it holds very little interest if any. Much too long at over 2 and a half hours to no purpose at all. It touches on the relationship of Maurizio and Patrizia on too superficial a level Unfortunately Al Pacino is a caricature of an Italian mobster.

It is somewhat underwhelming and a tad too long, but there are great moments sprinkled throughout the movie.The film is based on the real murder of Maurizio Gucci and the downfall of the Gucci family. It all begins when Patrizia Reggiani marries into the Gucci family and the rest is history.Lady Gaga is great as the ambitious Patrizia Reggiani but she is also inconsistent with her performance. Pacino, Driver and Leto are good per usual. It is however a daring choice by the filmmakers to have the actors speak in English with an Italian accent. It is not a huge problem, but it does occasionally take the viewer out of the experience.The first forty minutes of the movie are great. The characters are well introduced, and the plot is intriguing. The rest of the movie does not maintain this standard. The last 30 minutes are beyond underwhelming and the climax is cold and emotionless.There are issues with ""House of Gucci"" but the production design is not one of them. The film is beautifully shot and the locations look great. ""House of Gucci"" is very stylish and the costume department really outdid themselves.With everything said, ""House of Gucci"" is a decent film with outstanding visuals and great acting.

She elegantly portrayed the luxury that the Gucci family's power gives. The biography of the Gucci family is shown through intrigues, desires for big money, lust and the style of the Fashion House. The betrayal in the Gucci family is played out as if by notes, and shows ""The film is also a thriller.""
The nineties brought a new wave in everything: finance, fashion, relationships, and attitude to the word ""luxury"".

House of Gucci is yet another disappointing offering that ranks alongside other recent Scott directed duds such as All the money in the World, The Last Duel and The Counsellor as 'second-rate Ridley'.Loosely based on the Gucci family Italian fashion house story (what is with these all these crazy Italian families who implode after building a global empire), Lady Gaga takes centre stage and is excellent in her starring role as power hungry wife Patrizia Gucci. Indeed it's a heayweight cast on show here (Pacino, Leto, Irons, Salma Hayek etc) but the performances from the aforementioned are way over the top, bordering on parody which in turn ruins the realism - especially Leto's unrecognisable turn as erratic blacksheep of the family Paulo Gucci. Only Adam Driver as protagonist Maurizio Gucci fully succeeds in reigning in the over-acting chops.As for Ridley Scott, there is no denying the workaholic octogenarian still has an incredible eye and both the film's 70s/80s styling and eye for detail are spot on, but his direction is somewhat uneven, unfocused, erratic and rushed in the final act. No doubt the editing became an issue with an already 2 hour 40 run time to contend with but thats really no excuse - this needed some fat-trimming before the finale, not during it.All in all then House of Gucci is best summed up as overblown 'style over substance', yet it's still incredibly sad to realise that this debauched, greed-fueled filmatic family saga is based on true life events that ironically nowadays finds not one member of the Gucci clan still involved with one of the most legendary and successful brands in world history.

tt11214590,ur143621401,7,12 February 2022,"Greetings Fellow Film Buffs. I assume that Ridley Scott has been dying to make this film for some time as his Company purchased the rights from the author, Sara Gay Fordon, some twenty years ago. Lady Gaga heads up a sumptuous cast in this tale of ambition, greed, lust and betrayal. So all the essential elements for a stylish and lavish dynastic saga over three decades. Many of you may also remember the real life trial in the late nineties where Patrizia Gucci was convicted of murdering her estranged husband, Mauarizio Gucci.So the story kicks off with a young Patrizia (Gaga) pulling out all the stops to land the potential successor to the Gucci Empire, Maurizio (Adam Driver). Maurizio's Father, Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons) is bitterly opposed to the match on cultural grounds, after all Patrizia comes from a family of truck drivers. Rodolfo's brother, Aldo (Al Pachino), whose screen presence alludes to, the ""Godfather,"" of the family is impressed with the pushy scheming Patrizia and conspires with her. His own son, pudgy Paulo Gucci (Jared Leto), an incompetant fashion designer, is doing little to stimulate the flagging empire and Aldo sees Patricia as the impetus to revive the Gucci image.The action kicks off at a party in Milan where patrizia meets the awkward but stylishly sexy Maurizo who confides in her his dreams of going to law school. Naturally this all changes as the greedy Patrizia steers a better future for herself with Maurizio at the helm of the family business. Two hours thirty eighth minutes is a long time for a film and I can't help thinking a few scenes could have been cut down. The story seems to continually switch from the serious study of Gucci's scandalous history to a comedic melodrama where gut protruding Paulo provides some hilarious moments basking in his own self importance with a ridiculous Italian accent. Patrizia herself provides a little dark humour in her relationship with Pina (Salma Hayek), who ultimately proves herself to be a most unreliable Physic. I know it can be good to ridicule tragic events in storytelling but I am not sure it works here.Scott has certainly given us one of the most lavish films in recent years which will be remembered for some superb visual effects nostalgically set in Rome. Gaga would have killed for this part with the opportunity to express her understanding of changing fashions over the three decades, not to mention that her grandparents actually came from Italy. I believe that she even appeared in one episode of the ""Sopranos"" as a schoolgirl. Another weird fact is Ms Hayek is the real life spouse of the CEO of Gucci's present day parent Company. All that aside the Gucci family appear to be very disapproving of the Film and only time will tell whether the publicity ultimately proves to be negative or beneficial. It would have been a difficult task for any filmmaker to show the fractured history of the Gucci family in an entertaining way although the 'very talented' Mr. Scott together with his very accomplished cast certainly gave it a go. Special mention must go to Gaga who was made for this part and to Pachino who fully grasped his role.

But they used many stories from Maurizio Gucci's life that were unnecessary from a movie perspective and served no purpose for the story.The choice of language in the film was also disturbingly odd.

All the characters also used an incredibly strange Italian accent that wasn't fitting at all.

While The Last Duel is the antithesis of my (typical) movie taste, House of Gucci is the epitome. A big-budget drama with huge stars and a sinister story; what more could you ask for?-
Lady Gaga is British Vogue's December 2021 cover star, and in her interview, she stated that she stayed in character for a year and a half while playing Patrizia, and nine months of that was with the accent. I read this interview before seeing the movie, which really turned me off. It sounded like she wanted to boast about how committed an actress she is, but then I watched her interview with Stephen Colbert, and I completely shifted. She stated that method acting was easier for her when it came to this role. She wanted to be comfortable in the accent so it didn't feel like a performance but like an instrument already in tune. She didn't say that's how everyone should do it, that's just how she chose to do it, and I completely understood that mindset. Lady Gaga's performance as Patrizia ended up being one of my favorite aspects of the movie, and I'm glad she was able to beat out so many other stars who were vying for the role.-
While everyone in the cast was great, Jared Leto is the one who stood out the most. I've seen MANY comments saying he was far too eccentric (especially while in a pretty bad fat suit), but I enjoyed his crazy persona. And it's not like any of us know Paulo Gucci well enough to be able to say if Leto was being inaccurate. He is the chameleon of Hollywood, and I would be surprised if he didn't get a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.-
When it comes to the screenplay, I really liked it... for the first two-thirds of the movie. Once Gucci's leadership started to shift, the film lacked focus, and I got antsy. That is partly because viewers (or at least I) don't know what will happen in the end. There were some points when things wrapped up nicely, and I thought to myself, ""Why is there so much time left in this movie?"" Looking back, I don't think we got the build-up we needed to understand what was really going on.-
And of course, would this movie even be about Gucci if it wasn't for a stunning costume department? Everything about the visuals was beautiful, but I didn't expect anything less.-
House of Gucci was one of my highest anticipated movies of 2021, and it fell right where I expected it to: in the middle of good and great. While I did enjoy it, I don't know that I'm aching to watch it again, mainly because of how it dragged. And knowing that the Gucci family disapproves of the movie (especially Patrizia, who is alive and well), it feels like chumming for an Oscar. It's worth the watch, but keep your expectations around Gap, not Gucci.-

Out of the 2 films this year by him, this was definitely the weakest of them.This film would have worked much better if it was a darker satirical comedy, rather like Death of Stalin.The story about the mischievous shenanigans the Gucci's got up to could have been something really special, it had all the ingredients to do that, but sadly misses the mark.The film also suffers from one of the most underwhelming and cold endings I've seen in a while. It felt like the director just gave up and wanted to end things in a hurry.Adam Driver came across as too nice and his character change that lead to the events to his demise, somehow I didn't buy it.Lady Gaga needed to play it darker, she really had the juiciest role and needed the writers to make the most of it.Jared Leto performing his squealing Italian, it's laughable stuff. Jared, please fire your dialect coach, this movie did you no favours.Jeremy Irons started off with a semi Italian accent but somehow gave up midway, and switched back to an English one.

Lady Gaga. I wasn't sure how I felt about her as an actress and if I can take her seriously or not. But honestly, she will most likely be up for an Oscar for this one. Not only was she great, but the rest of the cast was top notch, as you would expect from all of those big names.House of Gucci is a true story inspired by the family empire behind the Italian fashion house of Gucci. The movie essentially revolves around Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) a very social and humble woman, who ends up marrying into the Gucci family, falling in love with Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver). Her strong ambitions begin to cause questionable decisions and relationships amongst the Gucci family, leading to a reckless spiral of betrayal, decadence, revenge and ultimately... murder. So is it good?The answer is yes. The movie is very well written and acted, thanks to Ridley Scott and his excellent cast of exceptional actors and actresses. Even though the movie starts to push its limits by driving past a two hour and thirty-minute runtime, it still manages to create enough tension and entertaining interactions amongst the Gucci family. I found myself not being bored really at all during the film, but some will. I think the pacing at times were a bit uneven, but the movie still manages to be quite fun and a good time.Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino) was the biggest scene stealer in this one. Whenever he is on screen the film is at its best. Aldo's son Paolo (Jared Leto) is the other scene stealer. Not to mention Leto's character is almost unrecognizable.

Adam Driver surprised me; He has the potential to be a phenomenal actor and history will remember him. The way he presented the change in the character was beyond words.

Who would eventually become ""Maurizio's"" wife. This is the true story of the iconic fashion brand ""Gucci"". This film is about the family of ""Gucci's"" and how a woman ""Patrizia"" maneuvered her way into a family looking for a pay day. Once achieving the ultimate goal (financial stability) it shows how greed, Deceit, revenge and madness that Ultimately resulted in the unthinkable tore this family apart. With ""Patrizia""being the main reason why.With a call sheet of A list actors showing off how phenomenal their GOD given talents are. From Al Pacino playing ""Aldo Gucci"", Jeremy Irons playing ""Rodolfo Gucci"", Jared Leto who was Unrecognizable playing ""Paola Gucci"", Salma Hayek who we just saw in ""ETERNALS"" playing ""Pina Auriemma"" and Jack Huston playing ""Domenico De Sole"" who we all might remember from ""Board Walk Empire"" as ""Richard Harrow""(Nucky faceless Assassin).It's crazy all this madness took place because a beautiful woman saw a nerdy rich guy that didn't know his own worth. She played a Strategic game to set herself up for life. The only problem, well one of the many I should say is that ""Patrizia"" even though she was smart, pretty and cunning. All those traits were equally matched with how crazy she was. She saw a water fountain of
Power and wealth and refused to stop drinking from it.I didn't know the back history at all about Gucci so it was cool learning about it all. I thought it was cool seeing some of the adversity the company went through. Seeing a young Anna Wintour was cool. I enjoyed seeing a young Tom Ford portrayed, while learning about his involvement in Gucci.Lady Gaga, and the whole cast Immersed themselves in their characters. Jared Leto being unrecognizable with the hair and makeup. Mixed with all the actors using Italian accents. All of them could win an Oscar. Lady Gaga like Will Smith coming from music is having an amazing acting career. I think she will win another Oscar for leading Female. If I had to compare ""King Ricard"" with ""The House of Gucci"" yet drastically different but still a autobiography I still think ""King Richard"" should win best picture at the Oscar's, with Will Smith winning best leading male.The only real critique I can give about this film, is it's a little long. But overall director Ridley Scott has given us some great pieces of cinema this year. Also I don't know what it is but man the fashion industry is dangerous. With Versace, Von Dutch, and Gucci to name a few. You wouldn't think about fashion being deadly but it definitely can be.I hate that Bob Ross, Gucci and the countless others all have the same thing in common. The family members with the actual last name, that started that company has no involvement with the company. They always get cut out some how. So all those millions go some where or to someone else. It's sad when you think about it. The acting is top notch in ""House of Gucci"" its five more fires quality acting. The movie as a whole though I give four more fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥

She was like a D Girl pulled from the extra department and pretended to be on the same level as Adam Driver, Jared Leto, Jeremy Irons, Salma Hayek, Al Pacino and even Jack Huston, who all nailed it. But I found Gaga completely out of place and more distracting than she was entertaining. I would have thought somebody more subdued like Natalie Portman or Keira Knightley could have pulled this role off better. But we get Gaga pushed down our throat and I gagged. Maybe there's some Divine Justice in the movie being almost completely snubbed by the Oscars. I give it 3 stars because everybody else was great, but Gaga wrecked what could have been a great film with her presence and improvisation.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur3408905/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur39561972,6,27 December 2021,"I definetely enjoyed this movie for 2 reasons: from a cinematographic point of view, as a ""movie"", i can say i liked it and it never, really never bored me 1 second. I was entertained for 2 hours and a half and i was even sorry when it was ended. Of course this is because due, also, (second reason) to the fact that it depicted a True Story of one of the most powerful families in the words inside the fashion industry: i was curious to see the saga of Gucci translated in a movie. It worked fine for me.There was something that did not convince me, though: the way that the actors acted looked a bit too forced to me. In my honest opinion, this happened because there were americans or foreign actors playing italian characters (real people in life, of course). I had the impression that both the characters of Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino), Rodolfo and Paolo Gucci were a bit ""forced"" , falsed and taken to the extreme in their attiude. They did not look ""natural"" to me. It looked to me like i was seeing a teathrical representation of an historical drama by Shakespeare.Once i read that the real Patrizia Gucci (not Patrizia Reggiani, the real Patrizia Gucci, son of Paolo), said that the film was faked, not correspondent to the real life and facts of Gucci family, and her father was wrongly depicted as an Idiot, i felt that my impression was true.For this point and the one mentioned before, i preferred to give only a 6.

To be honest, she's not horrible at body acting, but it's as if she only knows how to be great in depressing or hostile settings, and her exaggerated sexuality is strangely ""beyond"" the movie's plot. What, after all, can we say about the rest of the film? All of the locations recorded in Italy are stunning, and they give the viewer the impression that they are in the presence of a royal family rather than businessmen, and you can truly appreciate their wealth. All of the actors are good, but no one can compete with Al Pacino and his amazing rendition since Al Pacino is perhaps the greatest living actor of all time, followed by Jeremy Irons with his charming figure, and finally Adam Driver, who has given us many good films in the last decade. Unfortunately, Jared Leto is perfect, but as a native speaker, I find his use of a strong fake Italian accent offensive because we're talking about a very posh Italian family, and perhaps the best way to portray them in English is to let them speak like real posh British people because that's what they are and completely exclude this strange ""Super Mario"" accent. Italians, like British, Spanish, French, and other Europeans, have a distinct social class accent that distinguishes them; typically, rich people do not sound like poor or middle-class people, and rich ""bastards"" love to demonstrate their authority with a delicate and correct accent. So no, a ""Super Mario"" accent isn't going to work for me because Paolo Gucci was a wealthy son of wealthy parents. It was amusing to hear Italian actors speak better English than native English speakers on occasion! That's insane!

tt11214590,ur148553876,7,19 January 2022,"Director Ridley Scott has made a chic biographical drama, where luxury and style have the main role. The timing of the film is 158 minutes, but they look in one breath and fly by like 10 minutes. Lady Gaga plays Patricia Reggiani superbly. As she said in an interview: ""At first she played an affectionate cat, then she began to portray a cunning fox."" At the end of the film, she plays a predatory panther. Lady Gaga - well done. She elegantly portrayed the luxury that the Gucci family's power gives. The biography of the Gucci family is shown through intrigues, desires for big money, lust and the style of the Fashion House. The betrayal in the Gucci family is played out as if by notes, and shows ""The film is also a thriller."" The fact that the era of financiers and marketers is coming in the 1990s is evidenced by the fall of Gucci family members through idleness of life and betrayal.Director Ridley Scott has picked up powerful actors. This is Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Jared Leto, Jeremy Irons, Salma Hayek, and Al Pacino. I really liked the way Al Pacino plays. His Aldo Gucci is omnipotent, intelligent, adheres to the traditions of the family. Maurizio's phrase to Patricia: ""You are Reggiani, not Gucci"" - conveys all the coldness and neglect of Gucci family members to other people. Actor Adam Driver conveyed all the arrogance and weakness of the heirs of the Gucci family. The film shakes with its plot. I really liked the movie. In the cinema, time flies by imperceptibly. All the actors perfectly portray the grandeur and luxury of being aware of their involvement in the great Gucci Fashion House. It's both a drama and a thriller at the same time.The nineties brought a new wave in everything: finance, fashion, relationships, and attitude to the word ""luxury"". A luxury brand is a very desirable prey, but the arrogance of the Gucci family ruins everything new and non-standard.Chic, luxury, new money - it's all perfectly shown by director Ridley Scott.

The plot sorely lacks a direction through the (incredibly long) middle portion of the film and I found myself constantly asking where this was going. The pacing began to drop and the story ragged for an unnecessary time. Additionally, the final few scenes were rather anticlimactic and could've been executed with much more depth and dramatisation. What kept this film alive for me were the performances, in particular from Adam Driver, Al Pacino and Lady Gaga who all fulfilled their roles exceptionally. Adam brings Maurizio Gucci to life and Gaga's Patrizia Reggiani is wickedly brilliant. The impeccable chemistry between Gaga and Driver worked really well and lifted the film. Jared Leto's performance, as controversial as it is, was satisfactory to me in fulfilling his character. Another positive was the unique choice of soundtrack.

Music and sound design was not to over the top to take you out of the scene so I will take it as a plus. Leto's transformation into Paolo was fabulous, I didn't recognize him until the credits rolled. Every actor, Lady Gaga, Al pacino, Adam Driver, Salma Hayek played there roles perfectly.Since it was a predominantly a story about an Italian family doing fake accents all throughout the movie really ticked me of. The story could have been more captivating if it was shot in it's own language. Character development throughout the movie felt lost. The story had such a good start, it gave you so much so perfectly but the familial drama and manipulations that the later half had to deal with was rushed to the point where I felt like laughing at the most wrong times. The way the final act played out was almost comical and even though the movie has a gargantuan 2 hours 37 minutes run time it fails miserably to show the descent of Gucci.You start of sympathetic for Patrizia and Maurizio but it slowly transforms into something confusingly weird and later you don't know who what or how this happened (not in a good way, trust me). You start liking Patrizia, but then you hate her for what she's become and then you become sympathetic for Maurizio but that too doesn't work.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND to watch this movie as it's exhaustingly long with next to no returns for you.

Why did they hire famous actors and even Lady Gaga (who is surely very wealthy as a musician and does not need to expand into film) in the one film opportunity that one can hire actual Italian actors for and help propagate their careers? They would certainly be more authentic and portray the Mediterranean spirit.I recently read an article claiming that there is a lack of creativity in many new films leads to many biopics that were quite unnecessary at the moment. I believe that this can be an ""easy way"" to make new films that Ridley Scott is quite into. Why not focus on quality over quantity?Following, the shots last too long and the dialogues/script is shallow. The phrases you see in this movie are evidently unrealistic and cause one to cringe. The shots really let you understand how long this movie is. It isn't a captivating two and a half hours, rather you see the characters slowly walk, converse and exit the frames.As aforementioned, the casting was off. Not only are all the characters unlikable, which may portray their real personas, yet in a film this can be quite problematic as one is not invested in the series of events or plot. The trailer for this movie can be seen as a concise version of the film, tackling the main events as well. The scenes are incohesive, it seems as if there was no content control or shortening.

1. Lady Gaga's performance as Patrizia Reggiani is wonderful. She's an amazing actress, her expressions, accent and mannerisms were on point. It sure feels like she did her research very well because she always seemed really on character and she was always 100% believable. She was a delight to watch on screen and should be able to get nominated for the Oscars and Golden Globes.2. Salma Hayek and Jared Leto do an amazing job as supporting actors and even though their talent is mainly used (and to be honest a little wasted) to be the comedic reliefs, they are entertaining to watch on screen and they will keep you entertained. The movie's comedy is always on point and well-done.3. The costumes don't disappoint. All the looks but especially (of course) Gaga's and Adam Driver's looks are always amazing and really great to look out.4. The story, even though it's told with several plotholes and several things explained in a poor way manages to entertain you through the almost 3-hour length.Now with the negative aspects.1. The length of the movie is really unnecessary. I feel like they could have done a better job making it a little shorter, the editing is not that good. A lot of scenes could have been deleted and I don't think anything would have really changed as the pace is really bad. Some acts of the movie are really long and others feel so rushed and this is the kind of movie that needs your whole attention at all times, otherwise you will be lost and asking what just happened.2. I feel like they left out several key moments of the story. I'm happy I knew the whole story before watching the movie, because if you don't know it you won't really know how some things happened as the movie does a bad job explaining (or totally avoiding) several key moments. For example I would have loved to see the aftermath of what happened after Maurizio was shot. I found the ending very rushed. It would had been awesome to see the police investigating and realizing that Patrizia was behind everything. The ending feels very meh because you don't get to see anything of that. Really hoping they shot some of that and they include it as deleted scenes on the Blu Ray release.Overall I do think House of Gucci is enjoyable but the amazing cast saves the movie more than once because the pace and editing are bad.

I have no clue about the ""True Story"" this was based on and went into it with that lack of knowledge expecting a fun biopic.What I got was just that, at least for the first half. The movie starts out very fun, introducing us to the main characters Mauricio and Patrizia. As you probably have heard by this point, Lady Gaga does great. Everyone does great, basically. The Italian accents are quite painful and feel unnecessary. Italian would've been best, but plain English would have been a lot better than this slapstick accent stuff.After the first half, things go a bit wrong. Characters that are set up a certain way suddenly change overnight. Character development in this movie is more an on/off-switch than a slider, with characters going back and forth between polar opposites constantly. The character Paolo was a terrible attempt at introducing comic relief. He feels like a slapstick comedy act, talking about poop and massively overdoing the acting and the accent to the point where it's just painful to watch.The second half is just kind of a mess.

For me, the film turned out to be a dummy without any message and meaning, it is not clear what the director wanted to convey to the viewer. If they had filmed everything as it really was, then a good film would have turned out, the problem considered in the film would have acquired interesting features, namely the problem of inheritance, when children get the inheritance of their fathers, and they do not know what to do with it and eventually become hostages of the situation, and therefore unhappy in life. This movie is not for everyone, before you buy a ticket because of the star cast-read the real story. There were a lot of inaccuracies and misrepresentations of some facts in the film, but this does not mean that the film is bad.

Historical. Biographical. Crime Drama. Based on a true story and a book with the same name.Amazing. Very engaging and immersive. Lady Gaga has amazed me fully with her acting prowess. Not only has she matched her looks with Elizabeth Taylor, even her skills of acting seemed to rival the legendary actress. The few scenes where she wasn't on screen, I missed her terribly. She literally set the screen on fire portraying roles of a head over heels in love young girl, an ambitious and seductive married woman, a vicious serpentine schemer that stops at nothing to get what she wants.The story is about the events that had turned a family owned business called Gucci into a public owned company and one of the most successful firms today. Patricia marries Marichio Gucci - for his money and her ambition lead them down the path of betrayal and backstabbing of their own family members. With time and Patricia's true nature showing, their marriage falls apart and she gets kicked out of their house and marriage. Not setting her sights off the sky, she resorts to murder and ends up in jail.

More than the Gucci House, the film talks about the Gucci-Reggiani marriage. Without a doubt, Lady Gaga, Adam Driver and Al Pacino stand as the stars of the film, despite criticism of Gaga's Italian-Russian accent. All three present studied and understood characters, with nuances that allow the viewer to feel captivated. In contrast, Jared Leto's cartoonish performance broke the rhythm in all of his appearances, with a comedy that I didn't understand if it happened unintentionally, and that's why it feels out of place, or pushed in, and therefore doesn't feel genuine. Either way, it didn't work. The art direction seemed very appropriate, obviously favoring costume design, but with successes also in makeup and hairdressing. The musical selection with a lot of pop takes the scenes to the present time and they are enjoyed if you are a fan of that genre. Despite its two hours and 38 minutes, it did not feel long. But there was something that distracted me all the time, besides Jared Leto: the diversity of accents. I didn't understand why Lady Gaga had such a strong accent, while Adam Driver didn't, or why Jared Leto's accent didn't sound like Lady Gaga's; furthermore, why try to make them sound Italian when the movie is spoken in English, and why add Italian phrases here and there when the rest of the dialogue is in English?

After this event, the story plunges us into an intriguing series of events that show us the rivalry that exists within the family.From my point of view, this movie is one of the most revealing works we've seen in recent years, made up of great performances by the faces of well-respected celebrities. The long duration of this film is necessary to build the family strengths and weaknesses that grow with high tension as the film progresses. The script of this film is one of its greatest attributes along with its glamorous wardrobe, they play a great performance in aesthetic and visual terms that cover a complex story that carries with it a large number of decades.In conclusion, ""House of Gucci"" is a great retrospective for lovers of fashion, crime, family games and with a great construction of its characters since its inception.",1,2,/user/ur97469166/?ref_=tt_urv

Leto on the other hand seemed to think it was smart to take on some Jokeresque tendencies throughout the film, I don't know what the hell he was trying to do. He's supposed to play an emotional idiot, but he's so overly dramatic that the audience in my theater kept laughing at him at moments where he was definitely not supposed to be funny. He completely took me out of the movie and I just saw Jared Leto in a fat suit around a bunch of Gucci's.The pacing is a bit off and there are emotional bits that don't play well because of it. In the end, Maurizio is much more ruthless than he ever was throughout the film, but there isn't enough ramping for it to feel realistic to the rest of the film's characterization of him.

tt11214590,ur115624569,8,24 November 2021,"So first off let me just say all the performances in this movie are amazing. Everyone is played perfectly. Obviously the standouts are Gaga and Jared Leto although I thought Pacino was good as the ""boss"" of the family and Jermey Irons was solid. A performance I hope doesn't get slept on is Adam Driver. He played off that shy, lover boy perfectly.Now as far as the good for this movie thats all the films gets right. The movie has a base issue of it doesn't chose what it wants to be. The first 40 minutes are fantastic showing the love between Patrizia, and maurizio, but after that the tone completely changes and becomes a drama about the business side of gucci. There is also a good amount of comedy in this movie(mostly by Jared Leto) which feels misplaced. Any of these could have worked as the movies tone but when mixed together it feels inconsistentA big problem I also have is the script I mean my god this movie has the potential to be one of the best films of the decade but because of an awful script its ruined. Some examples of this are the fact that Lady GaGa is barley in the third act of the film so when Maurizio is killed you don't feel the emotion at all. The other script issue is the lack of time you see the whole family together. When you think of most of the great crime/mob films you see the whole family together. With a cast this good more time seeing them together is much needed.Now that leads me to my final issue which is the terrible ending. Good lord this ending is atrocious. Because of how lady Gaga is taking out of the movie for so long during the third act you dont see how much she is struggling and why she makes the decision to have her husband killed. They do a terrible job showing the downfall of Maurizio and Patrizias marriage which makes the killing feel insignificant. When the assassination occurs the way its shot feels very strange in an long slow motion take. Even after the death happens there is only five minutes left in the movie so all you get to see is the courtroom scene where subtitles pop up saying how long everybody went to jain for. Im so disappointed we didn't get a scene with Gaga talking to the rest of the gucci family after the death. God that could've been so good.So overall you might wonder why i gave this an 8 still.

That is the most glaring issue with this film. Everything looked so dull and desaturated. It was so incredibly distracting.I don't think even the best editor could have fixed this film.

tt11214590,ur54800402,5,6 December 2021,"With all the buildup that this movie had I thought it was going to be the most stylish thing to come out of Hollywood in maybe the last 15 years. I didn't know a damn thing about the Gucci family or legacy, but I figured with the cast and director that it had, it must be worth a look.Well, not really. Let me just say that there's nothing exceptionally terrible about this movie. The actors do their thing with their respective characters, convincingly enough. The problem I had with the movie overall is that nothing about it jumped out at me or gave me that ""Wow"" feeling or impact. The movie was a straight shooter, with the creativity and originality being rather low on the spectrum. It seemed like you could fill the same roles with a bunch of no-name actors and still get the same result. The scenery and visuals were nice most of the time, but we're talking Italy, so I would expect some beautiful environments by default. The soundtrack leaves something to be desired, at least in my opinion. I felt that this movie had a real opportunity to do something innovative or spectacular in the music department, but it really didn't. We get some of the cliched Italian operatic pieces (which is great stuff, don't get me wrong) that play during some scenes, but the rest of it was easily forgettable. The plot follows a very linear, rather predictable path, with little to no surprises that catch the viewer off guard.I must say I had a very weird feeling after seeing this film. Talk about ambiguous. I watched it with a friend, who I went out to dinner with afterward. We talked about the movie and I told her about the strange sensation I had about it that never really happened with any other movie before. This movie pretty much brought my mind to a stalemate, which I'm still conflicted about to this day. Like I said, it's not really good or bad in my opinion. I think that, in the end however, it will leave a lot of people disappointed more than satisfied. It felt like a missed opportunity, more than anything else.

The way they really shaped a narrative into that trailer that suggests a story that's quite different from the movie...Like, with Patrizia saying at the end of the trailer ""I subscribe to unconventional punishment"" and then hitting the cup twice, one would think she was some sort of mob boss. But that specific line isn't even in the movie and when she hits her cup twice, it's for no reason really.Also, Aldo telling her in the trailer ""this isn't a woman's game"" and then she looking at Marizio as if he wasn't backing her up, the trailer makes it look she was being left alone by Marizio to fend for herself. The way this scene plays out in the movie is also different.There are a number of scenes/sequences in the trailer (both the first and second trailer) that don't make it into the movie. While not a lot, the added trailer scenes and final edit of it definitely reshaped my expectations going into the movie.

But the interruptions were too infrequent, and totally oddly spaced, and set alongside loads of scenes where dialogue was delivered with totally unnatural interstices: actor A would speak, and a second later actress B would speak, then seconds later A--etc. This gave conversations a bizarre stilted feel. And, so, as I said, when conversations intercalated with interruptions were set alongside the more frequent, stilted conversations, the result was an absolute garbage-fire of directing/acting.But then something happens. I don't know exactly how it happened or whether it was intentional. But: either this initially jarring, annoying effect cumulates and eventually bubbles up in such a way that later into the film, everything seems to flow in its own idiosyncratic, weird way. OR, the directing and acting later into the film just improve. I don't know. If the latter, then the movie should be severely criticized for the bad first bits. If the former, then Ridley Scott is a clever, clever man deserving of our loudest approbation.Anyway. There's lots more to say. But i'll end just with an endorsement of Leto's hilarious role.it wasn't racist. **he did an impersonation of a rich white guy**. (Tuscans and/or Lombardians are not the mal-treated minority of American familiarity. They're the damn italian hegemony.) and the impersonation (or, just: *the role*) was *spot on*. His sound, his mannerisms were *exactly* the ones i've known in my close italian friends--theologians, chefs, linguists--in the UK over the last 6 years. His role was hysterical.

tt11214590,ur0384303,8,28 November 2021,"La decadenza dell'impero Gucci.Ridley Scott's second release in little over a month charts the crumbling of a powerful dynasty under the weight of greed, stubbornness, short-sightedness and betrayal. Reasons that spring from that most basic source of disharmony: power, in turn inextricably linked to money. Some want to get it all costs, others want to hold onto it for dear life. Roberto Bentivegna and Becky Johnston's multifaceted script further problematizes corruption by also considering it through an individualistic prism, aptly conveying how the rarified air breathed by the über-rich can either poison a seemingly decent person (Maurizio Gucci) or enable one predisposed to wallow in it (Patrizia Reggiani).Allusions to The Godfather have popped up in a couple of reviews; Maurizio's character arc resembles Michael Corleone's in Coppola's 1972 magnum opus. Although context and circumstances are different, both men lost their souls once they accepted the role of head of their family business. Or alternately, they let an unsuspected dark hole deep inside be filled by the ruthlessness required to preserve the empire bequeathed to them.Far more entertaining and stylish than its thematic cousin All the Money in the World, a treat for the eyes (Dariusz Wolski's lensing gets the most from the picturesque locations) and ears (the vintage needle drops add nostalgic pizzazz to the proceedings), never losing its multiple narrative threads despite the sprawling runtime, rendered dramatically compelling by a star-studded ensemble spearheaded by Lady Gaga, House of Gucci is, indeed, as Scott once referred to it, a ""high-end soap opera"".That's a compliment. The little hints of ironic realization, inevitable disappointment and sometimes even sorrow that flash in the faces of the fools who play this self-defeating game of one-upmanship prove that Gucci isn't the airheaded camp fest suggested by the trailers - or by Jared Leto's over-the-top caricature.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur0384303/?ref_=tt_urv

tt11214590,ur148560358,1,19 January 2022,"I can hardly be called a metrosexual interested in high fashion, but even I was curious about the tragedy of the Gucci family. The world-famous story of the fall of one of the most famous brands, which is literally synonymous with the word 'wealth', was already ready-made material for the film, it only remained to properly dispose of the material. The film was taken up by none other than maestro Ridley Scott, known for a whole host of cult films (""Alien"" and ""The Fall of the Black Hawk"") and the same mass of equally loud failures (""Robin Hood"" and ""Adviser""). Did he manage to implement such an interesting idea, or is it rather a blunder? It's a shame to say this, the second one is more suitable here.The main problem of the film is that it is staged without any frills, visual or narrative. There are, of course, chic costumes, but otherwise there is no highlight in the 'Gucci House'. The movie is absolutely bland and offers nothing. A straightforward story unfolds before us, running for two and a half hours and told without any revelations, and which can easily be found freely available on the Internet. Almost no moment of the film really catches, although there are scenes in which it was possible to roam. As an example, Maurizio Gucci, played by Adam Driver, is killed at the very end and it has no dramatic value, because almost everyone who wanted to watch the film knows that he will die. Empathize with the character also will not work, because there is no sympathy for him (we will return to this later). Could it have been done better? Of course! For example, you can start with the murder of Gucci, show part of the events of the film with flashbacks and scenes of the trial of Patricia Gucci (the trial, by the way, was never shown, although the plot here is also very interesting) and then wrap around the death of Maurizio. It would be much more interesting and the effect on the viewer would be much stronger here. But no, the story has remained just a dry retelling of well-known facts.Another significant disadvantage of the film is the characters. There are practically no complaints about the actors themselves, but the way their characters are shown in the Gucci House is questionable. Firstly, this is Patricia Gucci performed by Lady Gaga. The whole movie is not clear whether she really loves her husband, or just wants to squeeze money from him. And this is hardly done intentionally. It looks as if the screenwriter himself did not fully understand the essence of the hero. It was possible to easily build an intrigue based on the duality of her image, but there is nothing like that here. Secondly, this is Maurizio Gucci played by Adam Driver, who looks like he is an absolutely left-wing character. In reality, a real macho and lovelace here has turned into an insecure, self-doubting nerd, I'm not afraid to say. And everything would be fine, you can assume such a convention, but the problem is that in the second half of the film he abruptly becomes vindictive and angry after the hero has lost faith in Patricia. If Maurizio were the same here as in life, then such a change in the hero could be believed, but in this case such a sudden change of character from quiet and calm to unbalanced looks just ridiculous. About Summer in general, a separate topic. He overplays here so often and his image is so caricatured that it feels as if the hero he presented had escaped from some parody comedy or even a children's cartoon. Only Pacino and Irons were given adequately prescribed characters, although the latter is negligible in the film.But the biggest disadvantage of local heroes is that there is not a single gram of empathy for any of the heroes. Patricia, as described above, it is unclear what she is. Maurizio is initially presented as an idiot who fell in love with the first person he met, and then an embittered idiot who betrayed his family. Rudolfo (Maurizio's father) is shown as a typical narcissistic rich man. Paolo, in general, is just an unfunny caricature of a typical narrow-minded son. Only Aldo behaved adequately here, and then, by no means always. There is not one hero who would perform the function of an emotional core here and would cause the viewer at least some sympathy. It was possible to make a film about the near-Fonvizin heroes, since some of them are so grotesque here, but then the story should initially be made a satire about rich people who ruined themselves, and not a drama on serious topics. In the end, neither one nor the other really came out.As a result, we can say that the 'House of Gucci', rather, does not meet the expectations. Such an interesting story could have been realized many times better than it turned out in the end. Yes, this is not a completely lost film and maybe it's worth a look once, but for those who know about the interesting history of this family and those who were impressed by the impressive cast, they will leave the viewing rather disappointed. This is not even close to a pleasant surprise in the face of the 'Last Duel'. Unlike her, this movie is definitely mediocre.

I (shamefully) didn't know who the lead actress was at the time and thought I'd look her up when I got home cause she was a game changer...It's Lady Gaga. Spoiler: She'll win the Oscar for Best Actress this year. Hands down. Movie I'll give a B+ acting and experience a rare A+. Also Jared Leto had an unforgettable role that you simply can't miss.

The legacy of the brand and its name has soared far beyond the farmers son story they wanted to portray. And the story was dull. The color selection for this film was also very dull, making us feel like we were in the 1920s when we are well into the 70s, 80s, and 90s. I learned nothing new which was disappointing but somehow I managed to get less from the film that I've already known. I was expecting a breathtaking fashion show and never got that. The acting was impeccable which saved the movie for what it is. But this was an opportunity to give an amazing story and unfortunately, the story would've been a better watch on streaming.

For my family, Thanksgiving wasn't really much about turkey (vegetarianism tends to hamper the typical American holiday diet) or large gatherings (if you met my extended clan you'd understand). Rather, we typically were cloistered away in the dark comfort of the cineplex - sometimes taking in as many as three movies in a row, much to the chagrin of my father's aching back and wallet. Tickets are expensive enough, but you've never seen us hit that concession stand!2021 has been rough. It hasn't been the sweet relief from 2020 all had hoped it to be. I lost my beloved mother, but her spirit is with me every day. I've lost track of what letter of the Greek alphabet this virus and its endless variants have adopted as nomenclature. I feel sadder and fatter and more exhausted than ever in my life. There have been bright spots, sure, but I feel myself aching for the mundane joys of life circa 2019 (and earlier) more and more.Hell, writing this blog entry is both comforting and daunting. I crave the click of the keys under my fingers, barely keeping pace with the popcorn thinking in my addled brain. Yet, I also feel like someone has asked me to enter an Olympic pole-vaulting competition as I stare at this blank screen.My wonderful dad and I started some new traditions this year, with an eye toward our past. We met up with new pals for lunch (try the Lucky Moose/Turtle if you're in Fort Wayne - wonderful atmosphere and service and a menu that goes on for days, including many veg-friendly options), and we rekindled some longstanding friendships (Phyllis and Scott Gates are lovely, loving, lively hosts with a cocktail and appetizer array that deserves a Michelin star). And, yes, we finally got back into the movie theatre, safely masked and distanced with hand sanitizer at the ready. We skipped the concession line, though, for multiple and obvious reasons, and my father's wallet breathed a sigh of relief.We caught up with three marvelous films over the holidays. As I have the unfortunate habit of forcing patterns that may or may not actually exist on random collections, it was clear, at least to me, that King Richard, Belfast, and House of Gucci - taken together - explore, dissect, and celebrate the power of family - the good, the bad, the ugly, the essential, and everything in between.King Richard covers the developmental years of tennis aces Venus and Serena Williams and the fierce commitment of their parents Richard and Brandi. This is Will Smith's best work in years as he imbues Richard with a haggardly leonine focus that walks the fine line between Great Santini-esque obsession and Mister Rogers' ""you can do anything as long as you're having fun"" positivity. Aunjanue Ellis is an understated marvel as mom Brandi, a fine counterpoint to Richard's relentless push, filling in the humanity where Richard's parenting falls short. Jon Bernthal is a delight as endlessly exasperated yet mindfully hopeful coach Rick Macci. His Dorothy Hamill-ish bob deserves an Oscar. The film - never a bore and consistently entertaining - ends where it should, at the beginning of Venus' pro career and offers unassailable proof of the foundation to success that involved parenting provides.In Kenneth Branagh's semi-autobiographical Belfast, the parents play a similar yin-yang role in their children's lives. Jamie Dornan (shedding all the ooky kink of his Fifty Shades of Grey days) and Caitriona Balfe are on the razor's edge of heartbreak, their idyllic neighborhood torn asunder by the Protestant/Catholic ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s. The push-pull of Maslow's hierarchy of needs hangs over the picture, as Dornan's character urges the family to leave for greener pastures, and Balfe struggles with her husband's profligacy and not losing the creature comforts of family and friends sharing child-rearing duties. Judi Dench and Ciaran Hinds are akin to a warm, woolen, slightly scratchy blanket as Dornan's ever-present parents, and Jude Hill is a luminous find as the young protagonist Buddy, golden child of the family. Filmed in lush black and white, the film is a throwback to coming of age fables set against the backdrop of cultural turmoil like To Kill a Mockingbird, at times a bit too artsy for its own good, but leaving the viewer with a poignant, optimistic gut punch as the family finds its legs again.""These are your ghosts. Not mine,"" Maurizio Gucci (a compelling Adam Driver deftly balancing giddy nebbishness and aloof austerity) declares to his father, Gucci fashion empire scion Rodolfo (a miscast Jeremy Irons, desperately in search of an Italian accent by way of Downton Abbey), a spectre who lives hopelessly in the past. Ridley Scott's fizzy, haunting House of Gucci exposes the dark underbelly of family survival: love and admiration that curdles into resentment and maneuvering. Much has been written (unfairly) about the film and its script, claiming it's a loose amalgamation of riffs last seen on Dynasty and Dallas. Hogwash. That isn't to say there isn't plenty of escapist disco-era glitzy materialistic fun to be had, though.And, no, Lady Gaga - who is incredibly nuanced and infinitely watchable as Maurizio's ambitious, brilliant, tortured wife Patrizia - does not sound like Natasha of Bullwinkle fame. I was fine with the accents and mannerisms throughout the cast, Lyons notwithstanding. Italia! (I've never seen so many cigarettes smoked or espressos drunk in my life.) Pacino is in fine form as swaggering yet bedraggled Aldo Gucci, and a thrillingly unrecognizable Jared Leto is heartbreaking comic relief as Aldo's dingbat-yet-deeply-misunderstood child Paolo.But the star of the show is Gaga - she continues the stunning movie star path she began in A Star is Born, commanding the screen like Liza Minnelli or Susan Hayward, vibrating with the fiery frustration of a woman who knows the way ahead but can't quite reach past the male egos around her. Like Liza, her eyes can flare from limpid to enraged in a nanosecond. I'd watch her read the phone book at this point.Family defines us, shapes us, inspires us, frustrates us, comforts us. These three films unpack in beautiful form how one reconciles individuality in the face of such influence. Highly recommend them as a triple feature.

I have a Croatian uncle that talks exactly like that. Even if you don't agree with that and from what I've read and heard, most do not, he was still lightyears better than everyone else in the film except for Jack Huston. Jack was really great in the film. The problem is he wasn't in it enough.

Adam Driver was passible if barely and I really don't understand the campaign for Lady Gaga had for being nominated for any awards. She was the worst of all.Other than Jack Huston's character, everyone else was either an idiot or evil or both and the main thing keeping me interested was Ridley Scott's direction.

Despite feeling slow, all the scenes do add to and build up the story.Secondly, we need to remember that this movie is nearly 100% the true telling of real life events; this is not a fictional script that is written for the purpose of entertainment. Thus, it does not have the traditional beats of excitement we would normally expect. Instead, the movie feels VERY real. It almost has the illusion that we are watching the scenes live as they happen--like we are truly looking into the lives of these people.Based on that, the film is great, and the actors did a phenomenal job.

tt11214590,ur97389429,7,4 December 2021,"This film is dubbed as the film which tells the true story of how Patrizia Reggiani plots to kill her husband Maurizio Gucci. To me, this is slightly inaccurate. At two hours and thirty eight minutes, we do not enter this particular area of the plot until over two hours in. The film instead focuses on the development of Patrizia and Maurizio's relationship, the way in which she then manipulates her way into the running of the company and then the fallout from her meddling. This is not a negative point at all, the issue that makes this negative is the fact that when it is time to portray the major marketing point of the film- they actually have run out of time to develop motive, intention and a credible reason for Patrizia to engage two individuals for this heinous crime.The weakness in this picture comes from the fact that less and less detail is given in the writing as the plot progresses; a huge amount of development is put into the courtship of Patrizia and Maurizio and these are the most delightful scenes of the film which contain the perfect mix of realistic and life-like dialogue and corny speech which you would expect to find in 1950s and 60s European Romance Movies. This is perfectly fitting for the romantic, glamorous and movie-like courtship that makes a wealthy young man with the world at his feet, fall for an attractive, charismatic truck-owned business' daughter. As the film progresses we are given a chance to see the manipulative and deceitful nature of Patrizia as she plays the Gucci's off against each other, ultimately culminating in a massive fall-out amongst them. And then - everything feels rushed; the conclusion of the situation appears out of nowhere and before we know it Patrizia has found herself in a position to commit an unforgivable crime with no real rhyme or reason, other than the fact that she is a little irked. Come the final scene of the picture, it feels as if they've run out of time and had to tie it all up very quickly.This is through no fault of the actors - Lady Gaga gives a gutsy, charismatic and determined performance - when she isn't on the screen, you miss her. I did find however that later on in the film, her performance became very demonstrative and over-acted; this does feel like a fall-out from the poorly structured scenes in the latter part of the film. Adam Driver is grounded and subtle as Maurizio with great on-screen chemistry with Gaga. There a strong supporting turns from Salma Hayek and Jeremy Irons with Al Pacino gives a very strong turn as Aldo Gucci - Maurizio's uncle.The weakest performance comes from Jared Leto as Pablo Gucci; he does not only chew the scenery, but he swallows it, furniture and all. The performance feels like a cross between an audition for the gig of Mario and a Saturday Night Live sketch. He never feels truly in the moment and every single line is played to the back row...of Wembley Arena, not just the cinema.I found myself leaving the cinema conflicted and confused at to what Ridley Scott was focusing on when creating this picture; is it the sensationalised murder? Is it on how deceptive people can be? Is it a film about how businesses need to move with the times to stay relevant? All in all however, it is a fun few hours with a performance from Gaga as Patrizia Reggiani that Faye Dunaway wished could have been the outcome of her performance as Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest"".***1/2 stars out of 5.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur97389429/?ref_=tt_urv

And the slow parts weren't anything special that revealed a key piece of information. Unless I missed it while looking at my phone or watch or taking a snooze. I appreciate that they are recounting a true story but it wasn't anything really outstanding.I did think Lady Gaga looked fabulous - like a young Elizabeth Taylor however the character development left much to be desired in the first half. They barely told us any information about Patrizia's family and background to really show they were poor. I think her parents were in one scene?Not riveting or thrilling. I looked at my watch after the first hour and kept doing so a few more times. I almost fell asleep. I agree with other reviewers that it would've been better broken up into a few episodes of a series. That way they could've spent more time on Patrizia and Maurizio what their lives and attitudes were like before they met. I had no knowledge of the history of the brand Gucci before this movie to know what year it was established and was already an empire.They also didn't make the fact stand out that she reportedly ""made the brand grow"" or ""made Maurizio what he was"". Yes she pushed and influenced him to get involved where he previously didn't want to but there was no scenes where she was picking out styles or colors or involved with designing or marketing anything.Basically it was long and boring with a disjointed development of the storyline.

In general, the ""House of Gucci"" attracted me with the cast, and the fact that this is another director's work by Ridley Scott, well, in general, it was curious to see the family history of the famous fashion empire.I can say that ""The House of Gucci"" turned out to be a fairly smooth film, in which some events are gradually replaced by others, there are no incredible plot twists, in principle, it was interesting to watch the characters. But due to the fact that the film covers a decent period of the characters' lives, there was some kind of understatement, we can say that years flew by, the characters changed rapidly and it was difficult to catch all this on an emotional level.From a visual point of view, the movie turned out to be of high quality, the recreated atmosphere of the 80s and 90s, the attributes of that time, the views of Italy, beautiful costumes, dresses, handbags, Gucci shoes pleased the female gaze, the songs of those years fit nicely into the narrative.

The only exception is Paola Franchi, but too little time is given to this heroine of the story. Among the actors, Lady Gaga (Patricia Reggiani) and Al Pacino (Aldo) were the most liked. The American singer should definitely be among the contenders for the 'Oscar'. She was perfectly able to demonstrate the transition from a cautious girl to an imperious and sweeping away everything in her path furies. Al Pacino is trying very hard, although his image does not look very similar to the prototype. Pleasant musical compositions complement various scenes well.

In several of the 80s scenes there were songs playing that were from the late 70s. I know that is not a big deal for some viewers, but for me it comes off as sloppy. At times I thought there were scenes taking place in the 70s that were actually scenes well into the 80s. My second issue were the very distracting accents. They were awful. Some of the actors sounded Russian. If I were Italian, I would have felt insulted. The accents sounded too forced, inauthentic, and very cartoonish.

Gaga is clearly going for Oscar gold - so much so that it may be the most try-hard bid for a best actress nomination in film history. Then there's Jared Leto over-acting maniacally beneath layers of latex, giving a performance so crazed that it would seem overblown if he were playing a Batman villain. His scenes with Al Pacino are so indulgent that they seem to ramble on forever. In fact, they tend to derail the narrative in a movie already suffering from a lack of narrative drive. The only actor who emerges with their dignity largely intact is Driver, who somehow makes an essentially dull character fascinating.

Granted, Jeremy Irons and Al Pachino are at their usual best, however the shock was Lady Gaga and Adam Driver who really sold the roles. I've not been a fan of Driver due to his Star Wars appearance, but perhaps it was just bad material he had to work with.

I found it hard to figure out who people, such as Aldo Gucci, were until long-after they were introduced (I don't believe his last name was mentioned at first, but may be mistaken).I felt there should have been more scenes about the family, maybe more background.The first half - 2/3 of the movie was engaging, but then it was like someone slammed on the gas. It started moving at a faster pace, but not due to tension and building towards the climax, but due to the fact that they had to wrap it up.The relationship between the two main characters (Gaga and Driver) was paramount to the story, until Patrizia just all but disappears from the story. It was though it went from telling the story more from her point of view, and she was the one we were following and rooting for, and then it just completely flipped the script to focus on Maurizio. This would have been an interesting narrative, had it been done smoothly or cohesively. Unfortunately it was blunt and rushed.Overall, the characters and acting performances carry this movie.

My whole life I saw the name Gucci as something that was unattainable, something only meant for the rich. I thought that watching this movie would give me a slice of the world I would never know. A life of luxury and power. I used the last of my money to purchase a matinee ticket to this masterpiece of film. I walked in and sat down. Then the movie started, I was instantly immersed with the world of Gucci. Watching Al Pacino's performance brought me back to when I saw Scent of a Woman on my fathers VCR. It was the same commitment to the role in both movies. Adam Driver is one of the most brilliant actors of this age and his performance in this film proves that. When I saw Lady Gaga I was skeptical as I only knew her from her music but I did not expect her performance to be so moving. Jared Leto brought with his usual amazing performance with one of the most convincing Italian accents I have ever heard. After I watched this movie I knew something had to change.

Since all the movie dialog was in English I think it would have been better - certainly less distracting - for the cast just to do speak naturally, or just do the whole movie in Italian with an Italian cast and subtitles if you want authenticity. Plus there were inconsistencies, with a lot of bad Italian accents (Irons, Driver) or no attempt at one (Cottin, Andrews), and why at the altar do we suddenly have them pronouncing their vows in Italian (if you can call Driver's attempt that) ?I think that because of this linguistic chaos I felt everybody was overacting.

It's like everyone acted out their roles in a room alone in front of a green screen and were later all edited together.I'd say this was one of Adam Driver's most unforgettable roles. I was also expecting more from Lady Gaga, especially considering how seriously she seems to take herself as an actress now, touting how she stayed in character for the duration of filming, took 6 months to ""perfect"" the accent, and even studied feline behavior to capture the essence of Patrizia Gucci - because Italian women are so cat-like, of course.Overall, this movie fell extremely flat for me.

tt11214590,ur145376915,8,26 November 2021,"When we take a look on the outside of the 'House Of Gucci',our attention is immediately caught on the exceptionally clashing personalities of the movie, though through Gucci all persona's blend into one branded name. The House of Gucci.This is truly the beauty of the movie, each character just as complex as the next. Of course we do not get to see these characters one by one and their full backstory, we do get a sense of trust. As the audience sees each individuals traits, by human nature we relate to all of them. Each character in the 'House of Gucci' is really a reflection of human feelings, thoughts and reactions. Though our thoughts, feelings, and reactions may not directly link to Gucci, they do link to normal human life. We can see this being portrayed when Paolo Gucci, played by Jared Leto, has a hard time perusing his dream of designing his own fashion line for Gucci. Paolo is shown to be shut down by Rodolfo Gucci, played Jeremy Irons, and be betrayed by Patrizia Reggiani and her husband Maurizio Gucci, played by Lady Gaga and Adam Driver. We feel for Paolo as he is an innocent character with a dream, that has fallen victim to those who have manipulated him for their own benefit. Though on the other hand we understand Patrizia's determination and motivation to make Gucci and bigger and successful company, which is why we all fall into a melancholy feeling when she is shunned away by Maurizio. All in all without revealing too much plot wise, instinctively we relate to all these characters by human nature, which is why the movie is a huge success.Furthermore the cinematography used in 'House of Gucci' was to the highest standard, capturing lots of eye warming shots of the main cast in the peak of their roles. Dare I say, my heart grew with intensity and love watching this movie unravel, and it would've been nothing without the talented cinematographers.With all my love for the House of Gucci, I will say my two critiques. Number 1, the killing of Maurizio Gucci, could've been built up much more intensely, if you were to add the slow motion in when he was shot. I feel as it was quite a short build up, and quite a short killing, it was quite underwhelming. Though, I am not to say I did not feel a great deal of emotion through this scene, I do feel like it can be shot and carried out a lot better. Much wasted potential, it wasn't necessarily bad but not the masterpiece of could've been. On the other hand, I feel there was a great deal of mix in the soundtrack. There was a perfect use of classical music which fit perfectly in the vibe of Gucci, yet it was slightly tainted when some American Pop was introduced, not a bad choice in music, yet still I feel it tainted the atmosphere that was really Gucci.Overall, I feel this movie was spectacular. It is one of the best movies I have seen this far in 2021, that has been recently released this year. I commend the actors, film crew, director, producers and everyone who helped make this film a reality, it is truly a masterpiece. I left the theatres feeling quite fulfilled inside, with the warm feeling of euphoria you get, when your heart has just been fully contempt. Everyone should see House of Gucci.Father, Son, and House Of Gucci.",14,20,/user/ur145376915/?ref_=tt_urv

I've never found him to be particularly magnetic or possessing of a certain powerful warmth that draws you in and subtly seduces, but in his portrayal of Gucci, he had all of this.As for all the nit picking about who's Italian accent was most accurate, I really don't think the average viewer will fixate on whose vowel sounds were too guttural, or how many times Lady Gaga 'trilled' her rs correctly. It's simply a sumptuous, satisfyingly over the top movie about a larger than life family dynasty in the decadent atmosphere of the1980's excesses.

Personally speaking, I do expect more emphasis on the company's part, how they plan the style transformation, how the financial situation deteriorated/elevated through years. And the portion of the love affair (from the first meet to the birth of Alexandra) is too large.2. The music: this is what impressed me most :)

tt11214590,ur148561557,7,19 January 2022,"In my subjective opinion, 2021 seemed poor for quality films. In addition to the Cruella, nothing worthy came out. But by December of the same year, the situation changed dramatically. From the variety of hits, it was difficult to choose what to go for. And perhaps the 'House of Gucci' was one of the worthy options.First of all, I would like to note the magnificent author's and director's work. Ridley Scott managed to convey the atmosphere and outrageousness of that era. A wonderful picture from which it was difficult to take your eyes off. High-quality performance by all actors, without exception. Lady Gaga in this film, for me, as for many, opened up as an actress of the highest rank. I wouldn't be surprised if she wins the Best Actress award. It's been a long time since I've seen anyone get into the role as much as she did.I really liked the plot of the movie. It wasn't tight. In its timing, the film showed everything that was needed. Except for one explicit scene shown at the beginning. To be honest, I don't understand this trend of modern cinema, where sexual intercourse should be shown in as much detail as possible. By this action, the film artificially inflates the age rating, thereby reducing its audience. That is, with a family, you no longer go to this film, because of one minute of the film. It's a pity. The film is quite worthy of the attention of the audience.After seeing this film, people will get acquainted with the biography of the family that founded this clothing brand. They will see perhaps the most fateful events of this family. And on the example of the main characters, you can see the modern people who surround us today. Human nature is shown very well. What many people are willing to go to achieve their goals. How can some be blind and not see the meanness of others. How others are willing to take advantage of it. And the outcome that can await everyone.I highly recommend finding time for this movie. After all, every minute in it is fascinating.

Wow!!They showed everyone how to make a movie!The story itself is touching and pathetic at the same time. The story is about how cattle breeders became trendsetters. Then they felt like the celestials and eventually paid for everything with the loss of the empire. And also about love, hate, betrayal, greed.I didn't even know that behind such luxury... there is such a tragedy!The fashion theme itself is interestingly spelled out. When the empire was created by famous Italians, piece goods were produced, for example, shoes with insoles made of gold. When the empire was taken away by merchants from Arab countries, things became the property of the majority, lost their individuality, ceased to be an absolute luxury. They have become a source of huge earnings. Replicas appeared...There is also Italy in the film, beautiful views, luxury villas, fashionable clothes of the 80-90s of the last century.

Missed a lot of facts from the biography of the heroes, galloped through Europe.

tt11214590,ur149669396,9,7 February 2022,"The film of the year 2021 is «House of Gucci» by Riddle Skott, the producer of such films as «Martian», «Blade Runner», «Stranger». This film ranks with above-mentioned world-famous films and probably belongs to the science-fiction genre.Patricia Reggiani meets a modest lawyer Maurizio at a party, in which her last name, Gucci, fascinates her much more than her appearance or character. She seduces the guy, and soon he is ready to marry, despite the threats of father Rudolfo to deprive him of his inheritance. The couple moves into a small apartment, Maurizio washes cars with his father-in-law until Aldo Gucci contacts him. Uncle wants the guy to work for him: especially since Paolo's eccentric son is good for nothing. Maurizio is not eager to engage in family business and is happy in his simple position, but this alignment does not suit Patricia. She begins a complex behind-the-scenes game, which eventually ends in scandal, a series of betrayals and murder.What impressed me most is the court scene, in which the main character, in the face of the law, insists on her involvement in the Gucci family, as well as the return of Paolo's father from prison. The scenes were filled with vivid emotions, very sharp and opposite, which is why they remained in my memory for a long time. The plot of the film is fast-moving with some amusing episodes. To my mind, the brilliant acting of Lady Gaga, who is starring in the film, is above all expectations.To sum up, I can say that the film «House of Gussi» is that kind of film that takes us to a special world of history and richness.

But this one really didn't exceed my expectations at all.Someone in here said that it was like adults where playing pretend and I completely agree. All (most) brilliant actors but they were playing a stereotype. It was like a soap opera.Visually the movie is pleasing but it lacks any substance.Why Gaga is so famous and acclaimed it will always escape me, as she imitates a lot of female archetypes from the past half a century. I see her as an amalgamation of a lot of things and when she goes into a role, she wants to be good so badly, that she overdoes it. I did find her to be a better actor than I expected honestly, and I have some sympathy towards her but she puts too much of herself in the characters.It seams the movie was made just to show of some beautiful places and nice clothes. Like 99% of movies nowadays.The action doesn't make sense, the music doesn't match with the perioud or with what is actually going on.I just despise this haha spirit in which most movies are made... this way of making a joke out of everything even things you should not joke about like that. Yes I appreciate black humour but this is not it. It seams like for years now even great movie directors can't take seriously their own creations.It's all just about the money.I hope no one ever said this movie is about a powerful female character. It's a soap opera about the mentally ill bad queen who manages to seduce a gullible prince, destroy his family and his character as well in the process and after that murders him. It is powerfully absurd and cheap.For people who just ""wanna have some fun"" without regard for the real tragedy of a destroyed family and legacy yes....go ahead and watch it.For everyone else just go back to movies from the 20's onwards.

tt11214590,ur38024838,10,24 November 2021,"So I usually only post reviews of things I watch on very rare occasions, but this here is one of those occasions. House of Gucci with Lady Gaga and Adam Driver was something of a marvel to watch.The story of the Gucci name is truly a complex thematic tale of a grand scale that I don't believe most will fully grasp. That is, the idea of identity being attached to a name, a name that is one of extreme wealth and power. In this, the movie is more than the '80s musical undertones or the glam of fashion that I must admit is absolutely breathtaking. Through the Gucci name, Gaga's and Driver's characters both fail to understand themselves, and ultimately become corrupted by a business and affair that neither of them even care about. In essence, they lose their concept of who they are and find themselves lacking an identity separate from ""Gucci.""I really mean it when I say that Lady Gaga is the showstopper of the movie as Patrizia Reggiani. A charming, average-bred Italian woman who simply wants more for herself becomes immersed in the idea of what ""could be."" And through it, finds love, power, wealth, and yes, success. What Gaga does so brilliantly is offer us a glance of an innocent woman who aspires and fights for what she wants - even if she becomes blinded and corrupted through the process. She's doing what anyone else in her own shoes would do if given the opportunity after finding true love. The performance is Oscar worthy and Gaga's delivery is so spot on it's hard not to smile at the beautiful complexity of Regianni.Another random note about this movie is that I know little to nothing about Italian culture but I just get the sense that this movie does it right. From its casting to the accents to the cultural values of the characters, I couldn't help but be fascinated with the Italian culture. It's just another strong aspect of this movie that allows us a peek into the life of a particular ethnic community.Anyhow, I really loved this movie. It has some interesting jumps between scenes that feel rushed, but it tells a cohesive story that succeeds in developing the rise (and fall) of its character arcs. I particularly love the themes of identity, power, and love that course through the whole movie and how they interweave with one another. Gucci, in itself, is just a name. Without spoiling it, all of the characters come to learn this in one way or another just as we all do in our lives.

tt11214590,ur43592994,7,17 January 2022,"Almost didn't pay to see this in-theater because the reviews weren't great. Maybe because my expectations were low- I was very pleasantly surprised. Kind of a slow burn but it was entertaining enough not to feel boring.I thought Adam Driver and Lady Gaga were iconic together. Their lack of on-screen chemistry is often pointed out in negative reviews, but I actually think this was intentional. It was very jarring seeing such a dissonant vibe between the two, especially after seeing Gaga's electric chemistry with costar Bradley Cooper in A Star is Born, and similarly Driver's complicated passion with Scarlet Johansson in Marriage Story. But I think the essence of this film was in their constant awkwardness and dissonance.You got the idea that from the beginning they were never on the same page.Special shout out to Jared Leto as Paulo Gucci, I truly had no idea that was him until I went to write the review! Altogether I thought it was very well acted.The only big let down for me in this film was the scoring. I kept thinking to myself, ""why the hell is this song being used in this scene?"" It was most evident in the wedding scene. It was awkward, Ill-fitting and disappointing. I think a change of music in this film would have really elevated it.",1,1,/user/ur43592994/?ref_=tt_urv

I rarely review anything in here, but after having finished the film, i must say i am very disappointed.First of all - I'm no expert in italian accents, but to me the accents completely took away the focus from the dialogue, seeming forced and unnatural. In general, I found the characters very theatrical, unauthentic and hard to believe - all I saw was just Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Jared Leto etc. Speaking lines from a script and playing dress-up in their costumes.Second of all - I quickly sensed that this movie had a long story to tell and a lot to include due to the scenes being cut off so fast. There were moments in the film that could've worked out great if they hadn't been so rushed and instead had been able to breathe. This ultimately led me to have less sympathy for and be less interested in the characters and the story.This also resulted in clumsy character developments such as Adam Driver suddenly deciding his marriage is not working out in Switzerland and Gaga turning into someone who is willing to kill her husband..which didnt seem convincing to me.Lastly, the movie seemed confused about its own genre at times. The witty 80's music and things such as the almost parody-like Jared Leto character made me question whether I was witnessing a drama or a comedy.",1,1,/user/ur43660336/?ref_=tt_urv

One glaring failure is the editing which has allowed scenes where the shot is rolling as the actor prepares to speaks lines. Lady Gaga? A self absorbed Italian playing a self absorbed Italian. I suspect her fame has put the blinkers on reviews somewhat. She is ok at best. Al Pacino - a crusty voiced old Italian man playing a crusty voiced old Italian man.

As an Italian, it's just painful and sad to watch another movie nurturing these stereotypes. Besides, the protagonists of the story aren't Italian American mafiosos, but Italians living in Italy who obviously speak Italian to each other, not this inexplicable mix of badly accented English and badly pronounced Italian words... so the film language should have been Italian, or simply English, like any other story set in Italy but told by non Italian-speakers (I've never seen an adaption of Romeo and Juliet with Al Pacino in it..).I couldn't understand if it was just a hilarious parody displaying almost all the stereotypes linked to the Italian style (vulgarity, intrigues within powerful and rich families, fashion, crime) - Jared Leto evidently saw it this way, or an attempt of a greater commitment (like a bewildered Adam Driver seemed to think) that totally missed its goal.Sorry this came from Ridley Scott, who fortunately made a considerably better effort this same year, signing The Last Duel.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur5418145/?ref_=tt_urv

Honestly the only downfall of this movie is the director he failed to direct the other actors like he did with Gaga because of that some actors were overshadowed by Gaga in some sences and therefore he lost the base of the action and the climax was pretty weak for big flim like House of Gucci and that's pretty much it.,9,15,/user/ur57946405/?ref_=tt_urv
tt11214590,ur58435255,3,13 December 2021,"Unfortunately, the movie happened to be a big disappointment. I can't blame any of the actors - in my view they tried their best but the scenario and director just made their efforts completely irrelevant. Although the film is quite long it failed to properly depict development of main characters and explain the motivation behind their actions (however Jared Leto's character is a pleasant exception). Maurizio's transformation from a weak-willed but loving husband in one scene to a tough and violent businessman in another makes no sense at all. It feels like the director just had to make a tick in the checkbox.Besides, the movie is full of plot moves that appeared to be extremely important at first but lead to nothing in the end. For example, remember the scene when Maurizio and Patricia learned that they had to pay enormous tax to get the assets inherited from the late Maurizio's father? It even looks like they have to sell some share in the company because there's no other option. Guess what, in a few minutes this problem is just forgotten and Maurizio even offers to buy his cousin's share. Remember the house search by police due to which Maurizio had to flee from the country? Well, forget it, it appeared to be irrelevant for the whole further story. Those are just a pair of examples.To sum up, I have to give it a couple of stars for a really great cast and mostly persuasive actor performance and one more for a visual aspect.

tt11214590,ur80614824,7,26 November 2021,"Director Ridley Scott, knocks it out of the park once again, with his latest Picture ""House of Gucci"" (2021). R. Scott released two films this year, although, it's stronger, than his previous film this year ""The Last Duel"", which released last month, it still has it's flaws. Here's my review:""House of Gucci"", is a film about the real life story of the Gucci family. It follows Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) and his story of rise, fame, glory and tragedy. The film also features Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino), Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons) and Paolo Gucci (Jared Leto), as they play a big part in the story about their family and how it became, what it is today.The film has a runtime of about 160 minutes (2hrs 40min), which is longer than your average 'biopic'. The first and mostly second acts of the film are very strong, but at about the halfway point of the film, the runtime really starts to take a toll on you. Even though, the third act has the most important scenes of the whole film, it felt like the runtime, could have been reduced by about 20 minutes, if a few unnecessary scenes were cut from the film.The performances from the cast were great, but Adam Driver and Jared Leto shine and stand out the most. Very close, but not quite there yet, were the performances of Al Pacino and Lady Gaga. In my opinion, this is Driver's second best performance of his career, after Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" (2019), for which he got his first Academy Award nomination, for the Best Actor in a Leading Role. And I wouldn't be surprised if either Driver or Leto, get a nomination at next year's Academy Awards. Lady Gaga is also a good contender for the Academy Award next year.The cinematography of the film was pretty good, even though, it didn't get a lot of attention, mostly because the film is very character centered. My only complain about it was, that at times the film felt very dark, like there wasn't enough brightness. I mostly felt it during the scenes in the beginning of the film. It felt dark, even when they were outside on an afternoon. (It only may have been a specific theatre issue)The set production and art designs were good. Everything felt so extravagant, from sofas to lamps. Costumes were amazing, especially during the fashion show scenes. The main characters costumes also looked awesome, and let them to look fancy all the time. Makeup was also extraordinary. Jared Leto, had a full-on face mask on, to look older. Most of the time, you couldn't even tell, that it was actually him playing the role. The score was good, but nothing exceptional.Overall, the film is great, a bit too long, but great. The cast's performances, set and makeup production made up for the film's few pointless scenes. This is nowhere near to being one of Ridley Scott's best films, but it for sure is one of his stronger entries to his directorial library of films. I don't think, that it will get nominated for Best Picture. But I strongly believe, that it will get a nomination in Best Art Direction, Costume Design and Makeup categories. And it might even get a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.I'd recommend this film to people, who are interested in fashion, history of how things came to be today or just love a good ol' fashioned drama.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur80614824/?ref_=tt_urv

No. Is it an incredibly enjoyable 2.5 hour film that is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had at a theatre in years? Absolutely. 'Gucci' suffers at times from its long run and a script that gets lost in itself in the third act. But the acting performances are incredible and make for an insanely enjoyable film.Lady Gaga completely dominates this movie. I was worried she would get lost in the mix of a semi-ensemble movie full of veteran actors who are some of the best of the best. But if anything, she outperforms them. Her accent and cadence is not the caricature Italian accent commonly portrayed in media. But anyone who says she sounds Russian has not heard the real Patrizia's accent. Some of the accents are pretty hit or miss, some of them changing and inconsistent throughout the movie, but Gaga is solid throughout. She feels like the only person who perfectly understood the tone of the movie - even when it seems R Scott was not entirely certain the tone of the movie he was making. She lives up to the hype and more.As someone who generally is not impressed with Jared Leto's acting, I also saw him as a standout. His character - who is very much the caricature Italian stereotype - was a standout to me. I was hesitant to him being cast in this, but I was very impressed with his performance and laughed out loud multiple times at his parts.House of Gucci is, probably, not a Best Picture winner. There are times the script, editing, and pacing hold it back. But the stellar performances of the actors carry a movie that very easily could've been only decent to bad in the hands of less talented actor. Gucci is polarizing and unashamedly a campy drama that does not take itself too seriously. If you want to see high art, this may not be it.

The gay live-in relationship of the Van Rijn/Adams partners is quite unlikely in that period.The portrayal of Stanford White as a wimpy, middles-aged sycophant in his behavior toward the upstart Russells is also bad writing. White was a dashing rake (in his 20s-30s in the 1880s), noted for his ego and bravado.

tt4406178,ur65673698,6,5 February 2022,"This series is pretty far from being historically accurate but being accurate doesn't seem to matter any more I guess. Still it's what's not shown that would turn this from the farce it is into something worth watching. Keep in mind that this period coincided with the rapid expansion of america and the industrial revolution but mass production of consumer goods was still a ways off as well as mass and personal transportation that didn't involve animals. Before modern sanitation and common understanding of sanitation, bacteria and viruses, most people, at some time in their life, succumbed to at least one major illness and most likely a major life threatening injury. So before modern advances in chemistry, electrification, and telephony, and refrigeration and cooling systems. So even in high society areas of new york, most people would be appalled at the standard of living. There would be feces and garbage everywhere. The smell would be like living in a 3rd world country today. The houses would be mostly filthy which is why they had large staff in the first place. The kitchens extremely unsanitary and toilet facilities fit for a dive bar in oakland. And clothes...clothing fabric would be rather dull, hard to clean and maintain, and handmade. So considering the show is not even remotely period accurate what is the point and how far off are they to portraying society of the day. Well, most people of that period drank and it was a pretty male dominated society, and there was a common belief that most women suffered from 'vapors' and the houses they lived in were pretty chemically toxic and dangerous which people took all sorts of chemical cocktails to suffer through. To someone modern day, I suspect it would something like a madhouse, but more interesting than this boring, cliche riddled drama. The dialog is the worst part. I'd rather listen to cats mating than any more of this tripe.This period also coincides with the victorian era in england. I don't claim to be an expert on victorian england but I have watched quite a few productions on life in england at the time which mirrored american life. But, you won't find many productions on life in america, while the english seem to be perpetually fascinated by their past. So if you want to know a little something about america after the civil war and up to the 1900s, there are plenty of english stories to start with. Or, if you're ever in DC make a point of visiting the Lee mansion in arlington (particularly in the summer) where high society has been preserved since the 1860s.Yeah, I know they're not making a documentary but it's remarkable how many people use these shows to fill their history library.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur65673698/?ref_=tt_urv

Moreover, Julian Fellowes has hinted in an interview that he plans to introduce at some point a young Cora Levinson (later known as Cora Crawley/Lady Grantham), as it was known from Downton Abbey that Cora was known to both NYC and Newport society and was part of the less-accepted nouveau riche (thus the reason she was sent to London to find a husband).It's also interesting the references to the old 5th Avenue mansions.

tt4406178,ur132978068,3,23 February 2022,"Sure, Downton Abbey shamelessly romanticized and whitewashed the horrendously unjust, hereditary class hierarchy of the Victorian and Edwardian eras in England. But at least the show had a lot of charm, good acting and writing... and addressed the fact that the forces that would demolish once and for all those last, dying remnants of feudalism -- the social order typified by D Abbey and it's extended world -- was arguably just as bad: World War I, with its unspeakable and senseless brutality, and, along with it, the co-emergence of the merciless destructive juggernaut of modern capitalism. No period of change could be more ambiguous in its lack of anything to really root for; it was the death of one, terrible old social order and the birth and triumph of a monster system that was even more terrifying in its capacity for violence and dehumanization. So even though 90% of Downton was a love story to a fairly tale version of medieval patriarchal hierarchy, it was at least possible to sift below the surface-level romance to find some elements of the tragedy at the heart of this bleak period in which there was real beauty to be lost and nothing really good that could come as a result of all the upheaval the show depicts.The Gilded Age, on the other hand, offers us no such subtly and absolutely zero sense of the tragedy of this period of relentless, revolutionary, change that destabilized the entire social and economic order of the industrializing western world. Instead, it presents itself as a sweet, innocent paean to those great, unsung American heroes... the plucky, self-made made men (yes, the mf'ing ROBBER BARRONS!) who, poor guys and gals, could just never catch a break from NYC's crusty, snobby, bitter, envious old money... those cranky, stuffy, lazy, wanna-be 'aristocrats' who were trying in vain, by hook or by crook, to hold onto their diminishing turf in a world being devoured by the massive unregulated monopolistic trusts that faced no serous, organized opposition -- either from public officials or from the labor class that they so ruthlessly exploited to build their empires. Pity those industrious Russels, with whom we are undeniably supposed to identify, cruelly turned away from countless social occasions, spoken to with terrible snideness about their guache customs, and even denied attendance to the symphony in proper box seating. Oh, the humanity! However did those poor souls persevere through all that indignity?Have we ever really stopped to acknowledge, the show wants us to ask, our nation's profound debt of gratitude to the likes of saintly figures like JP Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, or the Russels for their immense contributions to culture, growth, egalitarianism -- and even our world renowned institutions of charity?Oh, boy....As ludicrous as that premise sounds, and despite the show's occasional nods to the utter amorality, corruption, and rapacious greed of the new-money moguls, the bottom line is that that that's *really* the basic frame of the narrative: the 'nouveau riche', as the robber barons are delicately referred to, are somehow proposed as the heroes of our story! They're actually presented as the unjustly treated forces of *progress* we're supposed to rooting for in this self-aggrandizing, revisionist soap opera piece of trash of a show.Yeah, the writing is crap, the characters are stilted, boring and two-dimensional, and the plot lines are cingingly soap-opera level drek. Alas, that's unfortunately what you get with most dramas on TV, including (tragically, IMO, given the glorious golden-age history of unparalleled works of TV art like the Sopranos), on 'premium' cable like HBO. But what makes this show so offensively bad is its basic moral/historical premise: that some of the most virulently sociopathic monsters in the history of the country are the characters we're supposed to like and root for in their quest for ""acceptance"" by the old-guard NYC elite.The terrible quality of all the basic elements of quality TV in the Gilded Age are no big surprise, sadly enough.

Some of th characters spew lines rather than speak or relate them. The weakest links is Louisa Jacobson, daughter of Meryl Streep. This is her first role and she simply and sadly is not up to the challenge. Her performance is wooden and on the level with a high school production. As her character is the focus of the early episodes the result is a poor performance which harms all the others and the story. The supporting characters suffer the same fate.

And the characters were rich and we fell in love with them from the very first moment.This is a premise I could care less about. Two women fighting over social position.There are two glimmers of hope. Meryl Streep's daughter, who's never acted before, was lovely, although they should have let her have her natural hair color, which is gorgeous. Hair coloring in the 1880s bothers me regardless. She gave a performance that shocked me and I'd no idea she was new to the business until I looked her up. Cynthia Nixon also shocked me. I've never been a huge fan, but she really pulled off the ""nice"" aunt, proving to me that she's a fine actor. And while I didn't see much from Christine Baranski, I know she's one of the best actresses working today and if there's a problem it's not with her.The second glimmer of hope is with the servant staff. Julian Fellows obviously can write them well and we were all much more in love with the servants then the nobility in Downton, so there's no surprise there. But things will have to get more spicy in the near future or else this glimmer will fade. And of course, this being America, we have to include a racial story line. Unlike the example shown to us so excellently by the makers of Bridgerton, we have to have this because it is set in America and we simply must show racism. But, Denee Benton's performance was on the mark, it was compelling and her character is interesting and shrouded in some intrigue. So I am hopeful.In the end though, if the premise remains, old money vs new, and two old ladies fighting over social standing of rich people, aka nothing, then I fear this show will fail. But if it becomes about rich characters in stead of rich old ladies warring, then I think it's got a chance.

Carrie Coon is being played against type (see her in Leftovers, an 11 out of 10 show on HBO, or in Fargo, a superlative show on FX) as the new bitch in town.

I was a little unsure after the first episode, but now that I'm a full three episodes in I've become as obssessed with this Julian Fellowes series as I was after just the FIRST episode of Downton Abbey.The Reconstruction Era, which preceded The Gilded Age, ended with what is still probably the most despicable and corrupt political bargain in American history, the Compromise of 1877, in which the Republican loser of the popular vote was ""allowed"" to assume the Presidency in exchange for what amounted to the repeal of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and the revocation of ALL Civil Rights for former African-American slaves across all of the States of the former Confederacy.The Gilded Age effectively came to an end with the Panic of 1893-97 that resulted in the worst economic depression in American history until the Great Depression less than 30 years later. The staggering disparity in wealth distribution that was the hallmark of The Gilded Age and the crippling economic effects of the Panic triggered a huge rise in the popularity of labor organizations, anti-Capitalist political groups, and ever escalating acts of violence by Anarchists. The assassination in September 1900 of newly reelected President William McKinley by an anarchist at the opening of the Buffalo World's Fair officially ended The Gilded Age and ushered in the Progressive Era, which brought about amazing advances in social justice and economic equality that all have been inexorably reversed since the Reagan Revolution of 1980, with the elevation of Vice President Theodore Roosevelt to the Presidency, an outcome seen as just as outrageous by ""mainstream"" politicians in 1900 as the elevation of Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson to the Presidency in Nov 1963 with the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur149330277/?ref_=tt_urv

tt4406178,ur149991639,7,16 February 2022,"This show has a good way of expressing the livelihood of the wealthy, rich elite from NYC a century ago. The Russells is a nice touch of big new money making a splash. Ms. Brook nice character to play neutral, open-minded niece to Ms. Van Rhijn old money. Has potential, shows need some time to really seize their identity. Hope the show just evolves slightly obviously as time passes but I would give S-2 a shot if Season 1 ends well.",4,10,/user/ur149991639/?ref_=tt_urv

tt4406178,ur150076725,9,19 February 2022,"I really like this tv series. Some other commenters seem to be disappointed that it is not an ""American Downton Abbey"", but you really can't expect that, the setting is different, the themes are obviously different, the history era as well. If you want Downton Abbey go watch Downton Abbey.Others mention that it is woke. Really? There is one black side character and one homosexual man. Sorry to break it to you, but in NYC, there lived tens of thousands (if not more) black Americans at that time and you can bet even homosexuals. These themes are not forced on the audience, they are tastefully and with respect to every side incorporated in the plot. I also like that the black character is portrayed in not a classic stereotypical way (black=poor and suffering), that's really refreshing and also factually right). Also, in Downton Abbey there we have a homosexual man too. You didn't mind him there?Others mention dullness or ""wooden"" acting. Well at that time people weren't so overly enthusiasthic about everything like Americans are now. I definitely didn't find the plot dull (I've seen 4 episodes now), though the plots and subplots are developing rather slowly I must admit. But I really don't mind it.I always watch an original HBO podcast on Youtube regarding each particular episode, where historic background is discussed and creators of the show chip in too. It's obvious the tv series is well researched and a lot of effort went into making of the show.",unknown,User-unknown,/user/ur150076725/?ref_=tt_urv

Downton creator Julian Fellowes wrote all of Downton by himself whereas Age has an American cowriter who's only other credits are Will & Grace, and Zoe Ever After.As a result, the dialogue about class, money, and the need the Old People have for keeping the New People out lacks the verve of Downton Abbey. Downton is quick slices of a rapier.

If it weren't for that distraction, I'd have given it 8 stars.The cast is great, most of the scenes are shot beautifully-a couple of the outdoor street scenes seem to have been rushed, or maybe they didn't notice the lighting issues-the sets are incredible, and the costumes, and hair and make-up are well done... with the exception of the construction issues.However, I only noticed these issues in the third episode, I'm quite enjoying it and I usually don't enjoy American period pieces as much as I do this one.

Not terrible acting by all but I'm confused by the choice of Carrie Coon and I'm not sure what is happening there, it's like watching my son play the tuba at his first school recital. Cringe worthy but I love him and he was 10 years old. There is not so much to forgive while watching scene after scene of Coon swooshing her skirt to and fro while she uses her best Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos founder) voice impersonation to deliver a high school level summer-theater performance. Cynthia Nixon, Christine Baranski, and Denée Benton are fantastic.

tt4406178,ur30634955,10,13 February 2022,"I'm amazed at the low reviews given by people who either bailed out in episode one or who are disappointed it's not Downton Abbey.To those who quit early and left a low rating on the way out, your presumption speaks poorly of you and dinged a marvelous series. Emphasis on series here - there is some necessary character development in the first couple of episodes as well as some world building for most of us who aren't so aware of the historic era known as the Gilded Age. This groundwork is critical, and as we pass episode 3 and look ahead, it's paying off wonderfully!To those who complain ""it's no Downton Abbey,"" well, of course not. How tedious that would be rather than this fresh look at another time and place where social norms and class roles are changing. In that it shares some similarities, but as a full-blooded DA fan, I find myself loving TGA all on its own merits.The cast is really clicking now, with my top kudos to Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector as Bertha and George Russell - such terrific chemistry and performances! I certainly would not want to get on the wrong side of Bertha or George. By the time you finish episode 3 - and please do so! - you will know what I mean about these two great actors and their characters.Christine Baranski is her usual top tier performer as Aunt Agnes, and a gritty contrast to a sweet Aunt Ada played to great effect by Cynthia Nixon. Their scenes are richly layered.Thanks to the production team and Denee Benton for her wonderfully designed and developed character of Peggy Scott, through whom we see race concerns of their time and our own developed in a compelling way without the crass wokeness so overly done elsewhere. This role in particular has tremendous potential and Benton is nailing the opportunity so far.I'm still working on liking Louisa Jacobson's take on Marian and the young niece as a character. Both the actress and her character are in the midst of so many strong players, it will be interesting to see how Louisa/Marian rises to her own standing amongst them.Add to this so many excellent ancillary characters and it's a robust world of dynamic people and events we find ourselves in, never sure who to root for or what will become of the ones we do.Yes, I love it, but only because there is so much in it to love!

I'm exhausted from all the hype. And no substance to be seen.

These folks are completely driven by greed, status, and selfishness. Unbelievable! We get it that there are pressures to fit in, but where's their humanity?
